{"text": "of the bigger rooms with four people one being temporary or or part time um", "duration": 7.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options", "duration": 6.67, "start": 0}

{"text": "we have uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working", "duration": 6.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "so how yeah mm hmm", "duration": 3.05, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms this we cannot really change i mean", "duration": 6.75, "start": 0}
{"text": "at least not us it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance but what is absolutely", "duration": 6.26, "start": 0}

{"text": "um", "duration": 0.642, "start": 0}
{"text": "well what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh the other group is uh i don't think we have to see them as competitors but they are just trying to to find", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "another local optimum or l uh", "duration": 2.71, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh", "duration": 0.947, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah uh uh we yeah i i think that's yeah there is no real competition between the two but", "duration": 6.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are actually it's", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's i think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to", "duration": 6.63, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm well you know find two two kinds of opinions yeah well we could have been eight h sitting", "duration": 6.32, "start": 0}

{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "well", "duration": 0.555, "start": 0}
{"text": "exactly i think so so today the goal is not to to find the solution today but to set some constraints and then", "duration": 6.48, "start": 0}
{"text": "go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences obviously we won't be able to accommodate all", "duration": 6.36, "start": 0}

{"text": "provide uh an arrangement but uh i think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to to work", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "out um so since all of you have a copy of the uh well of the drawing i think", "duration": 6.75, "start": 0}
{"text": "for the next time m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names", "duration": 6.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "on it but let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people", "duration": 6.86, "start": 0}
{"text": "say by projects or just professor and assistant so what would be f say first your preferences", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "since let's let's start with us maybe today um what do you think about it would you prefer to be alone", "duration": 6.5, "start": 0}

{"text": "um thanks for coming again to this meeting i hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "new rooms uh i hope you had fun in uh well designing something or uh", "duration": 6.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this so yeah that's what i was talking about it's for", "duration": 6.41, "start": 0}
{"text": "women's shirts um so um well i think you remember all the", "duration": 6.26, "start": 0}
{"text": "constraints and the new settings i think you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "move so we have these one person two person and three person rooms um", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "and so that makes i think eighteen places and we had about fifteen", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "people and some uh spare uh spare mm well working places to to put um may", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "i first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time", "duration": 4.71, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh great yeah so that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "but regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations", "duration": 6.59, "start": 0}
{"text": "between the rooms so that means basically well we have to do with this setting and uh", "duration": 6.91, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls so i think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "four years maybe and they don't want us to sh i mean they don't want to", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "provide an extra working space for gisella with the other i t  admins which we could understand", "duration": 6.33, "start": 0}
{"text": "because it's sort of full over there but uh at least that's what they said", "duration": 4.04, "start": 0}
{"text": "so it seems we uh yeah the well we cannot change the habits of the whole", "duration": 6.24, "start": 0}
{"text": "school just for us though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe but uh we'll see so regarding the", "duration": 6.51, "start": 0}
{"text": "possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms um", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "well it's not very easy we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing", "duration": 6.53, "start": 0}
{"text": "it it looks like it's not impossible at least on the one that is a bit uh longer on on the right", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh the one uh here it should be possible to put four persons if we could avoid it it would much simplify", "duration": 6.41, "start": 0}
{"text": "things but uh well we'll see", "duration": 2.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "no no no no", "duration": 1.62, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think yeah it it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture but uh since we are experts at this", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "task uh okay so maybe we could count on on four places but the final decision is not really ours so", "duration": 6.31, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh we'll see actually this", "duration": 3.48, "start": 0}
{"text": "exactly or one of the intern positions the people who might come or something like that", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "um okay so these were the um the answers so actually i", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "i did my uh my proposal as a slide would you like me to start or would you like me to end", "duration": 6.62, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's uh", "duration": 0.81, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh great", "duration": 0.884, "start": 0}
{"text": "beautiful okay then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale", "duration": 6.41, "start": 0}
{"text": "for for this so it's the same uh schema that you know in red you have", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "the uh uh oh excuse me that's quite uh annoying excuse me um hello", "duration": 6.26, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh yeah um can i can i call you a bit later in about half an hour i'm just in the middle of a meeting and i'm talking", "duration": 6.561, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh okay thank you bye bye um sorry for this fortunately", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "we were just uh the four of us um okay so let me get back", "duration": 6.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "to into the proposal after the brief interruption um so the names are in red", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "now um well one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more", "duration": 6.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "or less group people uh with within projects because i i think that sometimes they ju they just", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office", "duration": 3.49, "start": 0}
{"text": "and um which is quite happy actually i i also thought that some professors might", "duration": 6.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "enjoy or at least uh don't don't say anything about being with their assistants so i was happy to hear", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "susan uh saying that maggie and bruno could well together and pierrette and uh marianne", "duration": 6.64, "start": 0}
{"text": "in in the same office", "duration": 1.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so what i can say is uh that i also understood that susan", "duration": 6.56, "start": 0}
{"text": "would be rather in favour of uh well having her own office so uh it's it's it's working like this", "duration": 6.68, "start": 0}
{"text": "i put the lounge in the middle it's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "so i think that's not a problem because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office i guess", "duration": 7.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't know yeah maybe i thought in an angle but that's obviously not very", "duration": 5.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place here okay", "duration": 8.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah we'll have to check tha yeah but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for", "duration": 6.28, "start": 0}
{"text": "it maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer so okay but uh i wouldn't", "duration": 6.64, "start": 0}
{"text": "well insist on this i think okay so the printer well we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution", "duration": 6.94, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh i m two is more or less in the upper left side um i said more or less", "duration": 6.8, "start": 0}
{"text": "um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have swisstra and", "duration": 6.65, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the two projects from the list and then on the on the right side", "duration": 7.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe not a ver a very good solution for gisella if you can suggest something uh better because she's with", "duration": 6.48, "start": 0}
{"text": "two people who uh well two p h d  students and it's true that she has yeah a lot of phone", "duration": 6.43, "start": 0}
{"text": "calls to make but um it's some way to to solve some constraints i think this", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "is a very open thing uh if you want we can use this document or we could just say first", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one", "duration": 6.08, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.63, "start": 0}
{"text": "um yeah maybe not a very strong one then they maybe you are you have better suggestions um", "duration": 6.49, "start": 0}
{"text": "it was i think sort of one of the uh places they re that remain and i i think yeah there is no", "duration": 6.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "strong constraint and uh well she's a smoker but the policy is that we don't smoke so it's even better", "duration": 6.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "if she's uh with a second person", "duration": 3.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh huh okay", "duration": 2.314, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh huh", "duration": 0.676, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.628, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah mm yeah that was the case and uh she was a bit uh reluctant but", "duration": 7.012, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.63, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah we could store files there and things like that mm hmm", "duration": 4.004, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so if you want i can already do this change here", "duration": 5.268, "start": 0}
{"text": "sorry you're", "duration": 2.465, "start": 0}
{"text": "um", "duration": 1.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 1.668, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah th yeah th when the printer is yeah it's it's the main one we have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room but it's basically yeah the peop the the printer where everybody prints um so i change this", "duration": 14.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "so maybe i would suggest let me le k can i hear also let us hear from you", "duration": 6.79, "start": 0}
{"text": "and then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one then we go back to to this slide", "duration": 6.62, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah exactly and that means that all the constraints that we said and uh all the other things just we we well just basically disappear", "duration": 8.436, "start": 0}

{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.757, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah no exactly yeah tha tha yeah that's why i always try to put the to separate the visitors just to balance a little bit but okay we'll uh we'll be open on on that point", "duration": 10.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah it will become", "duration": 1.332, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.742, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm", "duration": 0.607, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.575, "start": 0}
{"text": "well so as soon as we have susan we can uh we can um so i would i would switch again", "duration": 5.86, "start": 0}
{"text": "da but that as i say it's just for the sake of the of the proposition so i even i'm even ready to uh to internally say that david will actually be in this room", "duration": 11.645, "start": 0}
{"text": "what does it what does it change names on the doors", "duration": 2.757, "start": 0}

{"text": "the psy psychological problem we have is pra i'm extremenly happy with that solution", "duration": 6.46, "start": 0}
{"text": "it would be a workab work working solution starting from january when paola will be here but currently if we present it as it", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "is we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student", "duration": 4.16, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah but you you really have also to say that that that a a unit has to has to have some some horizon i mean uh it's it's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us", "duration": 14.148, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh the second point i would suggest is that before you go to defend it you should uh mm circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con involved people", "duration": 10.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "to double check so that", "duration": 1.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "i would do it before 'cause you if you if you spend time defending a thing then um i don't know agnes comes to you or pierrette comes to you saying it no i don't want to be with marianne uh what do you do", "duration": 12.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "so so it doesn't", "duration": 1.749, "start": 0}

{"text": "so we we also have to have a led li led light on it", "duration": 4.347, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah it's i think it's usable", "duration": 1.694, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah or just a green one because it's if you use it it's green or the red it's r green", "duration": 5.335, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right but if you", "duration": 1.424, "start": 0}
{"text": "red's l shows up like something's wrong and green is like it's okay you press the button", "duration": 4.386, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i know okay we make it red", "duration": 2.224, "start": 0}
{"text": "you have to the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons uh that's cool", "duration": 6.802, "start": 0}
{"text": "no we have a recharger in it so", "duration": 2.46, "start": 0}
{"text": "if we can still make that then", "duration": 2.392, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it's cool if it was green green or red or whatever it is cool", "duration": 4.441, "start": 0}
{"text": "i just say can you s just say it again because i was just looking there's just a short", "duration": 4.882, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah okay", "duration": 0.895, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we can make the normal one also a normal light not a led light but as a normal one", "duration": 4.492, "start": 0}
{"text": "to flash up your", "duration": 1.649, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push so you see green if you push that button", "duration": 6.69, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but if you u if you do that you know that you're uh sending a signal and it's you also know which button you p", "duration": 6.735, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right but it", "duration": 1.692, "start": 0}
{"text": "but does it make any difference for the energy you use you got still one led", "duration": 5.299, "start": 0}
{"text": "that looks different yeah", "duration": 1.819, "start": 0}
{"text": "the same as a telephone or a mobile phone or what do you mean if you push", "duration": 4.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "it lights up everything lights up that's a good idea", "duration": 2.528, "start": 0}
{"text": "it it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much", "duration": 3.845, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's f yeah maybe that's a good idea for old people as well", "duration": 2.796, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's only few leds only four or something four led", "duration": 3.418, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's a good idea okay", "duration": 1.887, "start": 0}
{"text": "everything agre everyone agrees with that or okay", "duration": 3.171, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and then you", "duration": 0.814, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah", "duration": 1.145, "start": 0}
{"text": "but you have to make a sound device in it then", "duration": 2.595, "start": 0}
{"text": "but yeah", "duration": 0.977, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay are you almost finished or just", "duration": 2.614, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay okay no worry", "duration": 2.359, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i just want to talk some about some more so maybe you have to yeah okay", "duration": 3.652, "start": 0}
{"text": "so this oh sorry wh what's that", "duration": 4.084, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh oh sorry we have some new uh project requirements we have to have a look what they are they're still in um", "duration": 9.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet so a teletext option maybe we have to skip that one i'm not sure i don't think so but", "duration": 9.964, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and it's it's on your comp it's on your television it's only one button so i don't think it is we definitely should use it um", "duration": 7.701, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's uh what i told you the remote control should only be used for a television so that's maybe easier", "duration": 4.824, "start": 0}
{"text": "and um the the forty plus people i already told you", "duration": 4.148, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh no sorry oh this is a problem oh sorry about that the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty so it should be flashy or just more interesting i'm sorry about that i just i just didn't read it well", "duration": 14.903, "start": 0}
{"text": "so does it make some decision about that", "duration": 3.657, "start": 0}
{"text": "that still stays", "duration": 1.246, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.807, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah maybe we have to integrate that as well", "duration": 2.067, "start": 0}
{"text": "if it's possible but", "duration": 1.869, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't think it's very expensive actually why should it you only have a microphone in it", "duration": 4.788, "start": 0}
{"text": "nah maybe", "duration": 0.943, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that it we have short time to to put it on the market so that", "duration": 5.287, "start": 0}
{"text": "we have to do a lot of testing before we can do that", "duration": 2.696, "start": 0}
{"text": "we make uh make uh we can make th th the new remote control very flashy", "duration": 3.733, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.774, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think so", "duration": 1.617, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we have to make some decisions so you can see on the uh so we have to know what we're going", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "to put on do we do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything do if you press", "duration": 6.28, "start": 0}
{"text": "something it lights up for a few seconds so you can see what other but buttons there are okay", "duration": 5.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay we just take that one and what else we have", "duration": 3.808, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but it's oh th i thought would that that would be the same if you push something it it all lights up", "duration": 5.565, "start": 0}
{"text": "or you can switch it on or something", "duration": 1.988, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right you have to yeah that's right that's what i said it's the same as the telephone yeah", "duration": 4.612, "start": 0}
{"text": "and do we use a a uh what's it called like a imac if you can look through it or just a normal remote control", "duration": 10.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.614, "start": 0}
{"text": "different colours okay so y you just make it th through you look through it okay", "duration": 4.292, "start": 0}
{"text": "and so the buttons we have this is yeah this is normal we put in the the simple buttons on the top and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there", "duration": 9.631, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah maybe you have you have to uh when you use teletec teletext you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one or to go to the previous one", "duration": 10.52, "start": 0}
{"text": "o but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control because you ne almost never use it", "duration": 8.257, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right", "duration": 1.077, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah for me too it is so we just keep it one level then okay", "duration": 4.964, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.589, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.694, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.936, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but good usability so you can use it", "duration": 3.067, "start": 0}
{"text": "unique", "duration": 0.83, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i reckon", "duration": 1.646, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh i think mm", "duration": 1.431, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh", "duration": 0.83, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.606, "start": 0}
{"text": "but uh we also have to stand out 'cause there are already like you said so many controls out that", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "support lot of stuff but we have to make sure that we're better usability and stand out", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "by just looks of it so make it just a different colour or different shape so", "duration": 4.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah well", "duration": 2.574, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh", "duration": 1.314, "start": 0}
{"text": "there it is", "duration": 0.943, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay technical functions design", "duration": 2.668, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay well so we have s mm uh broad audience isn't that isn't true anymore but um we have elderly people so we need to keep it simple uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard", "duration": 13.705, "start": 0}
{"text": "so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls not too full like uh jens already said only ten percent is being used", "duration": 11.716, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i have it on the next page but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff", "duration": 6.9, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use and 'cause you have", "duration": 6.24, "start": 0}
{"text": "more room then and for elderly people big buttons uh an icon on it or text", "duration": 6.39, "start": 0}
{"text": "on it so it's very clear what that buttons does so it doesn't take much time to figure out uh", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "how to use it", "duration": 0.79, "start": 0}
{"text": "um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or", "duration": 8.246, "start": 0}
{"text": "just ask some random people elderly people what they use what they want on a remote control", "duration": 6.417, "start": 0}
{"text": "to find out but there is already in a", "duration": 2.772, "start": 0}
{"text": "one done of functions i could think of uh volume channels the the basic according to", "duration": 6.85, "start": 0}
{"text": "just one two three etcetera uh text service options", "duration": 3.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "um basic on off and i found an uh could i think of favourites", "duration": 6.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "i always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number", "duration": 7.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "but if you could make a new option that you just have to press one button and you get on your", "duration": 4.7, "start": 0}
{"text": "no y", "duration": 0.887, "start": 0}
{"text": "well it's it was just a thought so i'm i u i would find it handy i think when you just press one button and you get on six six six", "duration": 7.834, "start": 0}
{"text": "well uh what i was reading on the page uh a remote control just sends commands basics commands", "duration": 6.4, "start": 0}
{"text": "to uh the television so switch to channel six", "duration": 6.61, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh button six says says six and if you make favourites it can say six six six in a row", "duration": 6.64, "start": 0}
{"text": "just numbers that can be in the in the", "duration": 2.7, "start": 0}
{"text": "well if you said a favourite", "duration": 1.62, "start": 0}
{"text": "well i", "duration": 1.042, "start": 0}
{"text": "never oh", "duration": 1.414, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh are you", "duration": 0.849, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay now m maybe not", "duration": 1.629, "start": 0}
{"text": "no maybe elderly people uh right they don't like new features so maybe not", "duration": 4.653, "start": 0}
{"text": "um well play pause i dunno if that's usable when", "duration": 4.551, "start": 0}
{"text": "not anymore for t v  right on off i dunno miss did i miss any other buttons basic buttons", "duration": 6.698, "start": 0}
{"text": "i couldn't think of any other 'specially not for t v ", "duration": 3.178, "start": 0}
{"text": "is", "duration": 0.612, "start": 0}
{"text": "just the channel um uh what i mean is uh", "duration": 3.631, "start": 0}
{"text": "six seven eight or five", "duration": 3.342, "start": 0}
{"text": "um i dunno i don't have uh i did", "duration": 3.87, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i don't think you use that y only when you want to go to", "duration": 3.329, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time", "duration": 3.807, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think um f especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons so you have that uh", "duration": 7.012, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah the ten plus button just uh one one pressing or quickly after each other", "duration": 5.208, "start": 0}
{"text": "to just keep it simple and standard uh features", "duration": 2.816, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh yeah mayb but i think that's in the t v  as well that's how the uh the t v  t v  handles it but you can have a button that says um", "duration": 9.399, "start": 0}
{"text": "two two st two stripes so you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons", "duration": 6.708, "start": 0}
{"text": "so if you have a universal t v  controller you needed one button that has two uh stripes", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we have a a period of i dunno five seconds to press those buttons and that and not for elderly people", "duration": 6.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "to look one two uh press and aim and", "duration": 4.4, "start": 0}
{"text": "so i i don't think so uh i just thought of another one most things in modern t v s are also on the menu so you also need a menu button and then uh navigation uh", "duration": 14.9, "start": 0}
{"text": "but we can integrate that with volume and previous and next so you have", "duration": 4.286, "start": 0}
{"text": "four arrows", "duration": 0.943, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay but um", "duration": 2.327, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah a mute button yes don't think so", "duration": 2.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah well that's that's i think that's the layers that produce now i have to figure out what's uh what to put on what we're gonna use and later we can d uh do the design", "duration": 9.551, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay uh now my personal preferences uh using the standards basic", "duration": 5.088, "start": 0}
{"text": "um i think that we should stand out uh unique being unique with the design", "duration": 5.511, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we have to i dunno uh make a different shape than usual so when you are in the shop and you see our t v  controller hanging that it stands out not just in in the row when you see", "duration": 10.894, "start": 0}
{"text": "all the same uh remote controls", "duration": 1.987, "start": 0}
{"text": "um", "duration": 0.929, "start": 0}
{"text": "i dunno different colours um", "duration": 2.853, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah well why not or yeah", "duration": 2.46, "start": 0}
{"text": "well maybe you can look at uh mobile phones oh", "duration": 4.279, "start": 0}
{"text": "who", "duration": 0.576, "start": 0}
{"text": "they they're uh designed very well and well basically are the same just a bit smaller you think you can't make a t v  controller too small 'cause then you will always lo always lose it", "duration": 12.328, "start": 0}
{"text": "but uh well i think that's a good example", "duration": 2.584, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay sorry well uh yeah i i'm finished i think we discussed everything", "duration": 5.542, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh j is ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting", "duration": 4.718, "start": 0}
{"text": "so", "duration": 1.014, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah maybe uh", "duration": 1.478, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe depends on uh", "duration": 1.814, "start": 0}
{"text": "yes", "duration": 0.632, "start": 0}
{"text": "but maybe well we don't have to make it red maybe integrate it in the design as well", "duration": 4.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh oh maybe it's it is would an e no just uh", "duration": 4.549, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.719, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh", "duration": 0.868, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but it doesn't have to be red it's just to indicate something's on", "duration": 4.008, "start": 0}

{"text": "so mm", "duration": 0.891, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we have to uh make buttons for that as well to make it uh", "duration": 5.719, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.841, "start": 0}
{"text": "well i i use a universal uh remote control and list of all the t v s you have etcetera and you have to put in a number so it works on your t v ", "duration": 14.116, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay so we use that", "duration": 1.819, "start": 0}
{"text": "yep", "duration": 0.672, "start": 0}
{"text": "no y yeah", "duration": 1.53, "start": 0}
{"text": "no i don't think so but yeah i it it will look different and i think we need to find something else yeah", "duration": 7.781, "start": 0}

{"text": "and also it's", "duration": 1.178, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah when you press it so", "duration": 1.622, "start": 0}

{"text": "i i think uh the batteries will be uh a little yeah okay uh maybe", "duration": 10.619, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 1.073, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that it's working that it's not not the batteries are low", "duration": 3.322, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i know just to indicate it's working", "duration": 2.557, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh the receptor in the t v  senses the pattern so we have to understand what patterns are used to", "duration": 6.92, "start": 0}
{"text": "you know to make it universal so that it can be used with all the t v s we have to", "duration": 6.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "really understand what patterns are used so we can uh o on the otherwise it won't work", "duration": 5.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "no i i uh the chip um uh is producing the pattern so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to y you know to yeah that are working", "duration": 12.909, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah or i dunno how it's uh exactly how it works it wasn't explained there", "duration": 5.055, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.808, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.841, "start": 0}

{"text": "ah okay", "duration": 1.044, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 1.022, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah so it uh we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one because you have to yeah", "duration": 8.412, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh okay well uh y you have this chip that's uh when the circuit is closed it produces the pattern but uh ma basically for uh brands of t v  these patterns are different", "duration": 13.884, "start": 0}
{"text": "so like when you press a one on one t v  it go go to one and on the other t v  it won't work basically", "duration": 6.649, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}

{"text": "cha yeah changing this pattern all the time and um", "duration": 4.52, "start": 0}
{"text": "what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern this chip uh is trying to switch off the television", "duration": 7.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "and when it's uh switched off you can push a button as uh it's working now so and", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "then he saves that setting and then um it's working", "duration": 4.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.808, "start": 0}
{"text": "well uh the components yeah that's a bit technical and i hadn't i w i was a little short on time", "duration": 7.905, "start": 0}
{"text": "um but i think i understand it um the energy source is uh the battery basically um that's connecting to all the components", "duration": 12.615, "start": 0}
{"text": "because it has to be fed with energy okay uh the subcomponent is uh w", "duration": 7.549, "start": 0}
{"text": "i i think it is uh the button pressed so basically when you press a button a switch get closed", "duration": 7.217, "start": 0}
{"text": "um that's connecting to a chip so the chip knows what button you pressed", "duration": 5.388, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb i didn didn't put the description by this one th this is a normal bulb so the normal flashing light", "duration": 11.797, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah and this is a led too but this one is producing infrared light that's invisible and this one is producing normal light", "duration": 8.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 1.132, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah presu yeah yeah yeah because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work it can basically if the battery is low it won't work so you have to indicate that it's", "duration": 11.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "huh that's a good idea", "duration": 2.527, "start": 0}
{"text": "hmm", "duration": 0.64, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but mm like when you push it n n yeah you have your finger over the button so you can see yeah or or m maybe on top of the a green light is flashing or", "duration": 13.208, "start": 0}

{"text": "hmm", "duration": 0.382, "start": 0}
{"text": "it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t v  there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words it's not just you know noises like something hitting", "duration": 10.754, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out", "duration": 6.49, "start": 0}
{"text": "the t v  speech and the the user's speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}

{"text": "so i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems then yeah it'd be a really good marketing gimmick but i think we seriously need to consider how that would impact", "duration": 12.218, "start": 0}
{"text": "the situation", "duration": 1.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.436, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.308, "start": 0}

{"text": "no i think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements", "duration": 5.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.533, "start": 0}

{"text": "", "duration": 0.655, "start": 0}
{"text": "um well i mean maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments", "duration": 9.011, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm participant three", "duration": 1.395, "start": 0}
{"text": "nope here", "duration": 1.737, "start": 0}
{"text": "good", "duration": 0.517, "start": 0}
{"text": "thanks yeah and that's fine", "duration": 2.486, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so basically the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products so in our case existing remote controls", "duration": 13.014, "start": 0}
{"text": "and then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which isn't always as obvious we seem to", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad but when you look technically at how it", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "works sometimes that's not the case", "duration": 2.65, "start": 0}
{"text": "then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work", "duration": 7.72, "start": 0}
{"text": "um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are", "duration": 7.04, "start": 0}
{"text": "so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t v  on and off you need to change channels both", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing you need to be able to control the volume and then control", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "any menus on the t v  to regulate contrast or whatever", "duration": 4.28, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general", "duration": 5.429, "start": 0}
{"text": "the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do", "duration": 3.688, "start": 0}
{"text": "um often you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often", "duration": 12.304, "start": 0}
{"text": "and that the buttons are too small", "duration": 1.875, "start": 0}
{"text": "so here we've got two examples where here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons the buttons in a lot of cases are tiny", "duration": 11.199, "start": 0}
{"text": "um they're hard to see and okay they're labelled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much", "duration": 7.054, "start": 0}
{"text": "whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities", "duration": 7.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "that are needed and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first", "duration": 6.31, "start": 0}
{"text": "look at it so i would be inclined to go sort of towards this in terms of design rather than this", "duration": 6.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons", "duration": 7.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit or to a minimum sorry make frequently used buttons", "duration": 6.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "bigger and more strategically placed so like the on button being really obvious one the channel changing and the volume", "duration": 7.01, "start": 0}
{"text": "and to keep the design basically sleek and simple", "duration": 2.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "which i think ties into what christine and ed have both said fairly reasonably", "duration": 6.426, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so that's pretty much it an", "duration": 3.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't know if you guys have any questions or", "duration": 4.793, "start": 0}
{"text": "yep", "duration": 0.593, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay so i just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes minute what's it called i dunno whatever", "duration": 11.763, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so we just talked about uh oh you want me to show that there or", "duration": 4.312, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay we just talked about it looks has to look nice usability is very important people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones um", "duration": 11.844, "start": 0}
{"text": "it has to be very basic not too many buttons", "duration": 2.797, "start": 0}
{"text": "light switches on if you use a button uh text t v  still has to be a possibility", "duration": 6.196, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.976, "start": 0}
{"text": "hmm", "duration": 0.774, "start": 0}
{"text": "but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground so it has to be flexible", "duration": 9.117, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's a good that's a good idea if it's de like that that's good a good idea is it a bit like like the the the the remote control", "duration": 7.708, "start": 0}
{"text": "r  soft", "duration": 1.111, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}

{"text": "it's very uh difficult to to to do it because it's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control", "duration": 7.28, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay so hmm okay", "duration": 2.965, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control so the colours also so we have ha to ma make it in black black yellow", "duration": 10.886, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black", "duration": 3.167, "start": 0}

{"text": "a recha oh no uh battery it's just a battery yeah", "duration": 3.538, "start": 0}
{"text": "no just rechargeable batteries", "duration": 2.089, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "definitely", "duration": 0.943, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it doesn't really matter we just make it plastic", "duration": 2.695, "start": 0}
{"text": "the scroll wheels that's cool that's for the volume", "duration": 2.224, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.977, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.942, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't think that's an opportunity just skip it because we don't have time for that to to put it in", "duration": 6.471, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay", "duration": 1.246, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 1.044, "start": 0}

{"text": "no", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "no", "duration": 2.864, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.639, "start": 0}
{"text": "but maybe the form has to be a bit different not the sh the square form just a bit", "duration": 5.201, "start": 0}
{"text": "more rounded yeah", "duration": 2.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.909, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right", "duration": 1.178, "start": 0}
{"text": "so", "duration": 1.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these what exactly because we have to know it", "duration": 6.41, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the energy uh is the recharger we already know that just a normal battery okay", "duration": 6.68, "start": 0}
{"text": "the chip on print is a normal one", "duration": 2.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay the case is just a plastic one", "duration": 2.223, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah re yeah regular yeah okay yeah regular", "duration": 3.505, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.875, "start": 0}
{"text": "and we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel", "duration": 5.606, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's pretty much it", "duration": 1.212, "start": 0}
{"text": "and a flashy light", "duration": 2.046, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh i'm not sure but we do i don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment but", "duration": 7.164, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's for the next one that's for th", "duration": 2.561, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh that i think that's the next next meeting", "duration": 2.729, "start": 0}
{"text": "but you definitely get a specific instruction", "duration": 4.233, "start": 0}
{"text": "but th think about something that's more rounded just and more", "duration": 4.285, "start": 0}
{"text": "it has to be", "duration": 1.213, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh a bit just just on the top or on the bottom", "duration": 2.931, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this o um if you draw it like this you get a", "duration": 5.628, "start": 0}
{"text": "what the fuck is it", "duration": 1.448, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.673, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay mm", "duration": 1.676, "start": 0}
{"text": "doesn't work you see what i mean if i draw here", "duration": 4.988, "start": 0}
{"text": "it draws about four centimetres lower than nah okay just", "duration": 5.225, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe you can make it like this", "duration": 1.651, "start": 0}
{"text": "and this is all the wheel for volume so that you just um it's all rounded so you can do uh turn this one yeah but just not on the top but uh on the side of it", "duration": 11.851, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe i dunno", "duration": 1.516, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so we have this at the moment", "duration": 3.133, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so we'd have this is that okay", "duration": 2.324, "start": 0}
{"text": "and", "duration": 1.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "like this and uh what's the channel choose where do we uh put that", "duration": 3.505, "start": 0}
{"text": "still on the bottom or", "duration": 1.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's the numbers", "duration": 1.108, "start": 0}
{"text": "it doesn't make a difference if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other because you already have the volume here so you can also put it here one butt and the other one there", "duration": 11.098, "start": 0}
{"text": "next to each other back and forth so you can also can put it all on the top and this you keep this empty because you have to hold it as well", "duration": 8.036, "start": 0}
{"text": "but that's not want to zap very quick so", "duration": 2.797, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.639, "start": 0}
{"text": "is this a opportunity or you don't want a different", "duration": 2.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "why", "duration": 0.676, "start": 0}
{"text": "but still the next it's still the next one doesn't make", "duration": 3.128, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but fo from left to right is exactly the same it ma it doesn't make a big difference", "duration": 4.293, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it's exactly th", "duration": 1.342, "start": 0}
{"text": "i dunno i you already have the volume on the side so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake so it's uh", "duration": 4.978, "start": 0}
{"text": "so but that's for that's for you 'cause it's", "duration": 2.628, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so hmm", "duration": 1.525, "start": 0}
{"text": "what did what else we have to discuss about i dunno", "duration": 2.596, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.909, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the led", "duration": 1.032, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh yeah", "duration": 1.752, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah uh the logo was has to be on there yeah that's right", "duration": 2.796, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah five let's give five", "duration": 2.088, "start": 0}
{"text": "so y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger is that is that a good good opportunity so you could put it like that okay", "duration": 7.812, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh i'm not sure", "duration": 1.428, "start": 0}
{"text": "but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit", "duration": 2.662, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's all yeah", "duration": 1.516, "start": 0}
{"text": "just round it up", "duration": 1.617, "start": 0}
{"text": "no yeah yeah", "duration": 1.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "no just just the corners", "duration": 1.683, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.804, "start": 0}
{"text": "shapes", "duration": 1.01, "start": 0}

{"text": "it's a bit annoying isn't it", "duration": 1.785, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.812, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we have to make a decision what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have", "duration": 3.774, "start": 0}
{"text": "and you have the scroll button inside okay but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then of skip that one as well", "duration": 7.657, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah it's cool", "duration": 1.675, "start": 0}
{"text": "rubber spongy", "duration": 1.55, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so we have s still one minute left so just i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square", "duration": 6.325, "start": 0}
{"text": "no", "duration": 0.841, "start": 0}
{"text": "but i i think it's still for older people you j still have older people it's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that like f whatever just you have a normal", "duration": 10.328, "start": 0}
{"text": "but i it is it is it is already fancy because of the lights on the bottom of it that's already fancy uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel make it in in yellow or something just like the colours of real reaction", "duration": 14.951, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.577, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's right", "duration": 0.889, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.527, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah maybe the ones we are going to draw there maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this because it doesn't work properly", "duration": 13.212, "start": 0}
{"text": "so maybe you have to ask her", "duration": 1.279, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah that's probably", "duration": 2.392, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so just finish it so we make it a bit like m that one probably", "duration": 6.388, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah is that okay", "duration": 1.381, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay only the colour and the flashy light and the we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition", "duration": 7.973, "start": 0}
{"text": "or keep that it's okay but you'd definitely need a", "duration": 2.905, "start": 0}
{"text": "advanced chip", "duration": 1.307, "start": 0}
{"text": "so", "duration": 0.792, "start": 0}
{"text": "can we just put it speech recognition in it as well okay", "duration": 2.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.909, "start": 0}
{"text": "the function of that in there yeah", "duration": 2.021, "start": 0}
{"text": "and we need a probably we need a uh advanced chip then", "duration": 3.268, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it doesn't say anything about it does it", "duration": 2.088, "start": 0}
{"text": "it doesn't has to say anything just you have to just talk to", "duration": 3.153, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay we have to stop it now so just", "duration": 2.392, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay that's a r that's that's a advanced", "duration": 2.772, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah we just decide not to put it in because it's too difficult", "duration": 3.208, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay we just put it in because it's a good feature we have to stop now okay just we have to stop it now", "duration": 6.34, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's it won't wake up", "duration": 2.909, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i was a bit early like", "duration": 2.071, "start": 0}

{"text": "come on", "duration": 0.882, "start": 0}
{"text": "why won't it wake up", "duration": 1.358, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah but yeah", "duration": 2.016, "start": 0}
{"text": "soft sponge", "duration": 1.709, "start": 0}

{"text": "the the technology department", "duration": 2.086, "start": 0}
{"text": "they have done uh research about it and uh even more possibilities now with speech so they recommended using it well", "duration": 10.629, "start": 0}
{"text": "i'll check what they exact mean", "duration": 2.224, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uh", "duration": 1.377, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah th that's the only problem i d they don't say how much it will cost so um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition i think it would be better to implement l c d  as well", "duration": 13.028, "start": 0}
{"text": "since you have to uh configure speech thing", "duration": 2.633, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's that's something i dunno", "duration": 1.892, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so uh we gotta de", "duration": 1.705, "start": 0}
{"text": "we have to decide on that", "duration": 1.349, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm uh", "duration": 1.409, "start": 0}
{"text": "l d c  doesn't require", "duration": 1.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay and speech recognition", "duration": 2.33, "start": 0}
{"text": "advanced yeah", "duration": 1.551, "start": 0}
{"text": "i'll i'll give you my design", "duration": 2.063, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay so we well we can", "duration": 3.188, "start": 0}
{"text": "i had uh", "duration": 1.06, "start": 0}
{"text": "to make a sort of a design so i did some searching on the internet i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls", "duration": 9.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment i think we should go more to the ipod and m p  three players mobile phones more modern y yes", "duration": 15.085, "start": 0}
{"text": "um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller 'cause remote con control", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "you can see it here you have to bo reach both out both sides and here you just have one few", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "buttons so that's that's the main difference but looks uh i definitely think we should go", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "like this", "duration": 0.61, "start": 0}
{"text": "and then changeable fonts so", "duration": 3.044, "start": 0}

{"text": "well and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit uh basic buttons on off mute and th maybe two others i dunno text buttons", "duration": 9.744, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah text button maybe there and there and then the colour buttons if we want it on i don't find it very usable but it's uh i don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well", "duration": 10.908, "start": 0}
{"text": "so and then yeah we saw the the pla display in the the ipod they can put the basic buttons one two three four and uh f above ten and i think", "duration": 12.543, "start": 0}
{"text": "no no that th there is no display there but it's on the place of the display and i think we should uh light this up", "duration": 6.287, "start": 0}

{"text": "i dunno if we can use that do we want to use", "duration": 2.629, "start": 0}
{"text": "for volume well then we can even simplify it more", "duration": 3.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "by just putting the volume on the side and and just channel buttons here", "duration": 4.852, "start": 0}
{"text": "but i think uh", "duration": 1.494, "start": 0}
{"text": "well yeah well it's", "duration": 2.116, "start": 0}

{"text": "maybe i dunno but yeah we'll", "duration": 1.982, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah maybe it's not easy if it's below it's harder to zap so i think uh it should be", "duration": 5.84, "start": 0}
{"text": "should be easy to", "duration": 1.86, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think it's pretty standard these rubber buttons on the top", "duration": 3.252, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh if you don't light 'em up they don't uh you don't see 'em very good i think it's modern to light this area up and to light this area up so the focus gets on these parts and not on there", "duration": 13.612, "start": 0}
{"text": "but uh the position of course can be different it's s we have to look uh what's easy to use and how it's easier to use", "duration": 5.364, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we can uh switch these to i dunno if it l will look good if you put those on t on the bottom half", "duration": 8.084, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay yeah maybe those two yeah and uh yeah you have to make sure it's easy to uh yes it has to be big enough so you can hold it right", "duration": 10.569, "start": 0}
{"text": "well that's that's my findings so uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look m p  three player", "duration": 6.37, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition", "duration": 6.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "or something we i don't think we should put it on top then i think that if we're gonna put in more technology", "duration": 7.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "that you need to be able to uh switch it open", "duration": 2.33, "start": 0}
{"text": "to use", "duration": 0.782, "start": 0}
{"text": "so if you put in uh speech recognition you need so more uh many more buttons which won't look good on the front side i think", "duration": 8.212, "start": 0}
{"text": "so that's something we have to decide on", "duration": 2.036, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah okay", "duration": 0.853, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts with all with the the logo on it can we do that so", "duration": 9.156, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah but with all with logo on it", "duration": 2.693, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 1.718, "start": 0}
{"text": "well one of the options you can just like a mobile phone you can make um different fronts on it so you can just replace them i think", "duration": 9.115, "start": 0}
{"text": "that was the idea or just uh release one", "duration": 2.708, "start": 0}

{"text": "which w", "duration": 1.212, "start": 0}
{"text": "here you see one that's very round", "duration": 3.078, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah so y you don't want uh this uh like the ipod but", "duration": 4.756, "start": 0}
{"text": "more rounded", "duration": 0.852, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think it will just look like more like this one since it's this is also rounded i think i", "duration": 7.724, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay tho those are al already a bit cornered mm", "duration": 4.155, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay but then we have to think of something totally new", "duration": 4.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "i've uh i had a lot of picture of old ones and all curves have already been done", "duration": 5.579, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah i know we can do a lot more but", "duration": 2.223, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.482, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay but uh i had a lot of pictures oh i can show you here", "duration": 3.724, "start": 0}
{"text": "what the old ones look like", "duration": 2.163, "start": 0}
{"text": "curves curves", "duration": 1.188, "start": 0}

{"text": "that is for elderly", "duration": 1.444, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think if w my opinion if we just uh take the ipod and the same look so uh light or just whatever colour but the same light colours", "duration": 12.727, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh just with uh together with uh the back lights b look will look very new no rubber buttons or something just together with the back lights you'll get a totally new look more like the m p  three player m  um p  m  p  three player", "duration": 14.982, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah idea but you're if you look at the way remote controls are now", "duration": 4.754, "start": 0}
{"text": "and if you make it look like the ipod", "duration": 2.006, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay so that's already a very big change compared to", "duration": 3.656, "start": 0}
{"text": "ye yeah well uh", "duration": 2.374, "start": 0}
{"text": "could", "duration": 0.484, "start": 0}
{"text": "no i think oh", "duration": 1.337, "start": 0}
{"text": "think the scroll wheel won't be very big since if you put it uh somewhere the chances that it will scroll are too big so it will just be a small", "duration": 9.428, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah okay well maybe we can just open images there and i'll paint and paint", "duration": 4.566, "start": 0}
{"text": "i'll be able to do a better job", "duration": 1.466, "start": 0}

{"text": "well uh then it w", "duration": 1.855, "start": 0}
{"text": "well that's very easy we already have uh the beeping of the home station so", "duration": 6.272, "start": 0}

{"text": "um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls so i guess we j we just need that i don't know what they do or", "duration": 10.445, "start": 0}
{"text": "nah but they just said we need it uh the battery contacts like normal batteries ca you can put in", "duration": 8.749, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah but it i we don't wanna have a ar an how do you call it accu", "duration": 4.74, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay not a separate okay and uh a chip that's this one", "duration": 7.748, "start": 0}
{"text": "then uh i received some possibilities um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh like with the pulse watch so it operates on your wrist kinda", "duration": 15.086, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah i don't think it will work and or we can also use solar cells but you mostly use it indoors so", "duration": 6.516, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and and we can use the home station kind of thing um cases flat", "duration": 6.7, "start": 0}
{"text": "so uncurved uh two d  curved is um like front to the back", "duration": 6.36, "start": 0}
{"text": "and three d  curved is also in depth", "duration": 2.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "so that's possible uh but with three d  uh curved uh remote controls we must use rubber buttons so we can't use the flat buttons", "duration": 12.806, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think", "duration": 1.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "um these kinda materials can be used", "duration": 2.996, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think so too", "duration": 1.716, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah scroll wheels um", "duration": 2.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's good we can use multiple scroll wheels w if we want to but i think just the volume is enough", "duration": 6.141, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh the l c d  so we need uh the expensive most expensive chip if we use an l c d ", "duration": 8.114, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip so th so the regular chip because we use scroll wheels", "duration": 7.776, "start": 0}
{"text": "and um", "duration": 1.604, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that was it i guess uh are are we using a a rubber case or we haven't decided yet", "duration": 7.03, "start": 0}
{"text": "l yeah i it it should be soft you said so", "duration": 3.538, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah th yeah the chip is the the regular one you have the simple one regular and advanced so it's b should be regular uh the second", "duration": 6.148, "start": 0}

{"text": "i think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted", "duration": 6.851, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think it's probably better yeah but maybe we can make a a plastic so that you i if you like drop it it won't change the volume only if you use your finger", "duration": 10.954, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think in middle", "duration": 1.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh i think th the numbers should be in the bottom and and the switch channel in the middle", "duration": 4.342, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah okay", "duration": 0.862, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh but i think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other so", "duration": 4.205, "start": 0}
{"text": "because then it's it's easy to know m if i push the the the up", "duration": 5.999, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up and down button is if you put them", "duration": 7.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "but uh but i i think uh left to right is more often associated with volume and top down is more with uh channel changing", "duration": 8.273, "start": 0}
{"text": "in uh on most on most remote controls so so if we use that they will probably have a long learning uh time", "duration": 8.519, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.532, "start": 0}
{"text": "one point i can say by experience it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office", "duration": 10.708, "start": 0}
{"text": "plus the computers so", "duration": 1.94, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so we might be it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary", "duration": 12.388, "start": 0}
{"text": "a room with three people a working room", "duration": 3.932, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.408, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah", "duration": 0.612, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the other solution is to say okay we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for or", "duration": 11.463, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.58, "start": 0}

{"text": "i hope", "duration": 0.66, "start": 0}
{"text": "no it's a question i mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and", "duration": 4.375, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah we are on the sixth floor", "duration": 1.428, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and stop reading", "duration": 2.748, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah yeah", "duration": 0.632, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm yeah yeah", "duration": 1.365, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm so what about one of the room in the corner so you have three windows it's even better", "duration": 6.225, "start": 0}
{"text": "but you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that", "duration": 4.468, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.576, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.69, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we can exclude this one to make an office", "duration": 3.444, "start": 0}
{"text": "or maybe write on the board i don't know", "duration": 1.956, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah should we decide also the administration stuff and", "duration": 3.777, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we exclude the n the thing we are quite sure and then we discuss the", "duration": 4.372, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration", "duration": 3.956, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that just imply you expect people to come when gisella is not working and that's not really fair if you", "duration": 6.116, "start": 0}

{"text": "no but i think if if the main um how can i put that the mm", "duration": 6.468, "start": 0}
{"text": "if the main reason to put to to choose gisella's place is the proximity of the mailbox it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room", "duration": 11.22, "start": 0}

{"text": "our group so we're moving to a new building uh it's gonna be the building across the street and we're actually moving", "duration": 6.31, "start": 0}
{"text": "in three weeks but the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office", "duration": 6.96, "start": 0}
{"text": "in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer the fax machine all the big equipment", "duration": 7.0, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment and they want to know", "duration": 6.27, "start": 0}
{"text": "where we're gonna do all this by november second", "duration": 2.27, "start": 0}
{"text": "so that means basically next tuesday and since we don't really have any", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "other time we have to make these decisions today what we're getting is nine rooms for a", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}

{"text": "there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't um there's two views either of the old town or the mountains", "duration": 6.28, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the rooms have various sizes there's two three people rooms five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building so you actually", "duration": 6.36, "start": 0}
{"text": "get windows on two walls and two one person rooms", "duration": 4.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's pretty much what the building looks like um and then you have the number of people per room the courtyard", "duration": 6.72, "start": 0}
{"text": "because we're on the sixth floor you can't actually go out to it but it just means that the windows look out onto open space", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "um you can see the bathrooms the elevators are sort of further down the hall the", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mail boxes all", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "of the windows open you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building", "duration": 7.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like i said the photocopier which is really big the fax", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "machine which is not so big and the printer which is relatively big", "duration": 5.26, "start": 0}
{"text": "each office has a white board a bulletin board and a coat rack no cupboards like we have in the current", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "offices and each person gets their own chair their own corner desk so like the n the ones that", "duration": 6.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "we have now um a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small i mean they're about that tall", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}
{"text": "and one sort of hanging shelf so we don't get the bookcases like we have now but just one shelf that's attached to", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "the wall", "duration": 0.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the people that we have to place uh you can see the list there along with", "duration": 6.53, "start": 0}
{"text": "their position and the project that they work on and i guess the question the first question is", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "how we want to organise people whether we want to do it by rank or by project", "duration": 7.16, "start": 0}

{"text": "i don't know put all the p h d  students together all the professors together that sort of thing", "duration": 6.34, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the idea is that we come up with a plan there's another group who's gonna be working", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "on the same plan later this week and then andre and i have to do presentations for", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "the university administrators on the second so we have to come up with a plan", "duration": 6.63, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.54, "start": 0}
{"text": "so anyone have any ideas or", "duration": 5.524, "start": 0}
{"text": "i guess", "duration": 0.756, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah um i think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building so as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed then it should be okay to leave them in the hall", "duration": 12.116, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documents or n whatever", "duration": 4.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "um well we get one sort of networked printer and then i think some of us have personal printers i think susan has a personal printer gisella has one maybe", "duration": 12.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "i can't remember who else yeah but no one else gets their own printer in terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now", "duration": 7.46, "start": 0}
{"text": "um", "duration": 0.708, "start": 0}
{"text": "so what i'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and", "duration": 6.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "to exactly where to put people", "duration": 2.61, "start": 0}
{"text": "does that work oh and on the map the little half circular well quater", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "circles are doors which i'm assuming you've figured out but just in case and there's just the one room", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "that actually has two doors going into it the the three person room on the right yeah", "duration": 5.45, "start": 0}
{"text": "yes yeah a lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room", "duration": 4.548, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we should leave a space for that and we can because like i said maximum eighteen", "duration": 6.35, "start": 0}
{"text": "people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us and i don't know if you've noticed but two of us", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "are only here half the time so martin and david um are half the time at the e p f l ", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "and half the time in geneva so", "duration": 2.6, "start": 0}
{"text": "sort of keep that in mind i guess when", "duration": 3.028, "start": 0}
{"text": "you are doing the actual planning", "duration": 1.524, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.388, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm yeah", "duration": 1.684, "start": 0}

{"text": "no", "duration": 0.324, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.548, "start": 0}
{"text": "which i don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them", "duration": 4.484, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah either that or maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or", "duration": 6.58, "start": 0}
{"text": "like with the the photocopier or maybe not the photocopier but the printer", "duration": 3.94, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah", "duration": 0.9, "start": 0}
{"text": "and not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker", "duration": 3.428, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this", "duration": 4.843, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah that makes sense to put the fax in there", "duration": 3.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh", "duration": 2.036, "start": 0}
{"text": "so", "duration": 2.164, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.612, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.468, "start": 0}
{"text": "well the third option is just completely mix everyone up which some people say is better sort of for a", "duration": 6.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "group environment so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project right so if you share an office with someone", "duration": 6.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "who's on a completely different project you find out about that project but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis", "duration": 6.78, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.596, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting but if", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's empty then sure you can use it for a meeting there's nothing wrong with that but i think if someone's already reading in there it's not fair", "duration": 6.61, "start": 0}
{"text": "to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting 'cause", "duration": 2.85, "start": 0}
{"text": "but if you're having a short meeting you don't really", "duration": 2.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "make an appointment for it you just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever", "duration": 6.084, "start": 0}
{"text": "'cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal", "duration": 3.732, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.507, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and the other marianne too so there's three of you", "duration": 4.02, "start": 0}
{"text": "well but then you either share offices with each other which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time", "duration": 8.788, "start": 0}
{"text": "so you're still going to have", "duration": 2.756, "start": 0}
{"text": "like unless you get individual offices i don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that", "duration": 7.972, "start": 0}
{"text": "'cause even if each of you share with a professor then it's the same thing for the professor", "duration": 4.883, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it is something to keep in mind", "duration": 1.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight", "duration": 11.588, "start": 0}
{"text": "no", "duration": 0.596, "start": 0}
{"text": "no but you sort of see people's patterns i mean", "duration": 2.804, "start": 0}
{"text": "even if it's not always like that i mean if it's like that you know eighty per cent of the time then", "duration": 5.94, "start": 0}
{"text": "but you're right we can't make assumptions too much", "duration": 3.309, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think", "duration": 0.788, "start": 0}
{"text": "well it's up to us how we do it i can see benefits of both", "duration": 6.43, "start": 0}
{"text": "but", "duration": 1.028, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah plus the computers", "duration": 1.436, "start": 0}
{"text": "and we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office", "duration": 4.052, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room", "duration": 4.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "then everyone has an office right 'cause it's maximum eighteen", "duration": 4.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "so take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen and you're right if we do have a stagieur whoever who comes in then we have nowhere well we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose", "duration": 11.109, "start": 0}
{"text": "mm hmm", "duration": 0.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.532, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.516, "start": 0}
{"text": "or again find people who don't work the same hours", "duration": 4.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "it doesn't completely solve the problem but", "duration": 2.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i think so", "duration": 0.878, "start": 0}
{"text": "a one person'll be too small anyways", "duration": 1.876, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah so i should have explained that", "duration": 2.82, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but then you get don't get a lot of light", "duration": 1.748, "start": 0}
{"text": "for reading", "duration": 0.676, "start": 0}
{"text": "really", "duration": 3.684, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's", "duration": 0.859, "start": 0}
{"text": "i dunno i like the idea of looking out over", "duration": 2.324, "start": 0}
{"text": "lots of space", "duration": 2.023, "start": 0}
{"text": "well i mean that that's the whole point right it's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space", "duration": 9.636, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.484, "start": 0}
{"text": "we have some shelves like cabinet type shelves for the reading room but it's not really intended to be a library i mean we have", "duration": 7.86, "start": 0}
{"text": "an i t  library um but", "duration": 3.604, "start": 0}
{"text": "the other idea is to take 'cause right now we all have bookshelves so one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people put them all into that room so it becomes sort of", "duration": 12.378, "start": 0}
{"text": "a mini library but not like a library system library just go and borrow your collegues' books", "duration": 6.052, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think the middle one", "duration": 1.156, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah it's also sort of m central to the layout so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to", "duration": 6.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's not that it makes that much of a difference but", "duration": 2.178, "start": 0}

{"text": "uh th ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra in case we go for the display okay", "duration": 6.79, "start": 0}

{"text": "the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that", "duration": 6.16, "start": 0}

{"text": "ergonomic shape which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}

{"text": "idea is that people can actually do sort of quasi measurements on their hand size so if someone has larger hands", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "you have a wider remote control", "duration": 2.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "so that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "is to put a flip screen on it just like you have on flip phones so that you don't have this case where someone", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}

{"text": "um you had issues with the batteries running out so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}

{"text": "and um tactile feedback on button presses and like you said speech recognition", "duration": 7.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "so in terms of what this thing would actually look like", "duration": 3.7, "start": 0}
{"text": "despite working in interface design i'm not the greatest artist in the world so you'll have to forgive me", "duration": 6.145, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.776, "start": 0}
{"text": "you'd have something like this with an on off switch fairly big sort of in the corner and by itself so you don't accidentally turn your t v  off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for oops", "duration": 14.836, "start": 0}
{"text": "channels and volume sort of for surfing channels and then volume so the volume would be the up and down 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right and then here you'd have your sort of standard telephonish", "duration": 15.076, "start": 0}
{"text": "number pad", "duration": 1.044, "start": 0}
{"text": "and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t v  and", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "on the other side a way to turn off the voice control so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}

{"text": "", "duration": 0.278, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so again you can have a little l c d  light somewhere the flip", "duration": 4.619, "start": 0}
{"text": "thing and have i forgotten anything", "duration": 3.074, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't think so so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted to keep", "duration": 6.78, "start": 0}
{"text": "is keep it simple not have too many buttons not have too many functionalities thrown into it think the design can pretty", "duration": 6.31, "start": 0}
{"text": "much carry over to everything although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something", "duration": 6.44, "start": 0}
{"text": "slightly different", "duration": 2.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but you also have to d start watching out for the weight 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight", "duration": 6.32, "start": 0}
{"text": "of the remote control you don't want it to start getting too heavy but that's the general layout with the general functionalities", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "if we come up with something else as you can see there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "you do it customisably you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large depending on", "duration": 6.48, "start": 0}
{"text": "personal preferences", "duration": 1.24, "start": 0}
{"text": "so that's pretty much all i had to say i mean everything else in terms of design issues um the centering of the key pad and", "duration": 9.316, "start": 0}
{"text": "the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "the remote control the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently", "duration": 4.14, "start": 0}

{"text": "so if we're trying to keep costs down then maybe sacrificing the display", "duration": 6.212, "start": 0}

{"text": "so uh", "duration": 2.085, "start": 0}
{"text": "we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components", "duration": 6.37, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh the case the power supply uh the means of communications with the", "duration": 6.4, "start": 0}
{"text": "television set in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have microphone", "duration": 7.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "well no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device but um maybe you do", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um", "duration": 6.14, "start": 0}
{"text": "so it could be in the television set could be in the device but somewhere you have to put the microphone um and", "duration": 6.42, "start": 0}
{"text": "a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost um so", "duration": 6.29, "start": 0}
{"text": "the other w thing that we so our method for going about this is we've looked at", "duration": 6.31, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh the histo hi historical record what's worked what hasn't and then we also um", "duration": 6.36, "start": 0}
{"text": "we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because course", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities", "duration": 6.39, "start": 0}
{"text": "to offer us so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research", "duration": 5.5, "start": 0}
{"text": "so um for the case um we told we were making a specifica specific", "duration": 6.73, "start": 0}
{"text": "assumption that it would be curved in design course you know i wanted it to be expandable and", "duration": 6.13, "start": 0}
{"text": "shrinkable but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non option", "duration": 6.38, "start": 0}
{"text": "we can uh we can really seriously explore so then we were thinking about um rubber", "duration": 6.53, "start": 0}
{"text": "but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and", "duration": 6.2, "start": 0}
{"text": "th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's", "duration": 4.27, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh goes with the board", "duration": 2.025, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after", "duration": 6.24, "start": 0}
{"text": "a while so um we still had titanium and and wood available but um unfortunately", "duration": 7.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "d curved cases out of titanium although how apple did it with th powerbook", "duration": 6.28, "start": 0}
{"text": "i'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood", "duration": 5.81, "start": 0}
{"text": "so this is our finding and a as she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material", "duration": 6.63, "start": 0}
{"text": "so we're we're currently uh proposing uh we'll get to all my personal preferences", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "in just a second so then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board", "duration": 6.52, "start": 0}
{"text": "but uh these simple chips but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple", "duration": 6.26, "start": 0}
{"text": "one and um then there was the regular which i regret that i've", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one uh the other option", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "was this advanced chip on print and uh we liked th we we found that", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "it it includes this infrared sender which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "the right chip", "duration": 0.68, "start": 0}
{"text": "and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor", "duration": 6.85, "start": 0}
{"text": "and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print so uh", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i'd", "duration": 6.27, "start": 0}
{"text": "really think we should you know use some of uh some really exotic woods like um you know", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods", "duration": 6.43, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think that people will might really want to design their own cases you see they could do", "duration": 6.18, "start": 0}
{"text": "sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their orders kinda like you submit a custom", "duration": 6.51, "start": 0}
{"text": "car order you know and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather", "duration": 6.23, "start": 0}
{"text": "and things like that and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone", "duration": 6.61, "start": 0}
{"text": "and speaker on the advanced chip so this is the findings of our research and", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have", "duration": 6.49, "start": 0}

{"text": "look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market", "duration": 6.8, "start": 0}
{"text": "and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah you know", "duration": 6.19, "start": 0}
{"text": "what it is it's exactly how it looks and whatever okay so uh no this", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay that's and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros so we have to uh use a big market in europe", "duration": 6.496, "start": 0}

{"text": "oh yeah that's a good question", "duration": 2.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think it's i'm not i'm not sure it's not mm i think", "duration": 3.726, "start": 0}
{"text": "i don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five euros so not sure but", "duration": 6.724, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control okay perfect", "duration": 4.58, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control", "duration": 5.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "no just everything", "duration": 1.012, "start": 0}
{"text": "so yeah what what what's a remote control it's just a black thing with some buttons on it it's not nothing very special but um yeah that's right", "duration": 10.436, "start": 0}
{"text": "so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user", "duration": 5.22, "start": 0}
{"text": "hmm yeah", "duration": 0.754, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's right should be a good point", "duration": 1.972, "start": 0}
{"text": "just big enough for the buttons we have that's that's it", "duration": 3.076, "start": 0}
{"text": "but you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open okay yeah that's cool maybe for the d v d  pla player or something if you just okay", "duration": 9.618, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.388, "start": 0}
{"text": "why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control there are buttons on it", "duration": 3.695, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.532, "start": 0}
{"text": "but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it", "duration": 3.016, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 1.377, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.388, "start": 0}

{"text": "no", "duration": 0.34, "start": 0}
{"text": "you can put games on your remote control whatever", "duration": 3.57, "start": 0}
{"text": "oh maybe that's a good idea just to put it on your television and just s recharge you never have to use any batteries", "duration": 5.688, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger", "duration": 3.412, "start": 0}
{"text": "i dunno", "duration": 0.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "", "duration": 0.891, "start": 0}
{"text": "uh if you th look at the market it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it because maybe it's too expensive", "duration": 5.812, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah that's right yeah", "duration": 1.699, "start": 0}
{"text": "the option just the option that's cool", "duration": 1.908, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.436, "start": 0}
{"text": "has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or", "duration": 7.943, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.404, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.614, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah just for the t v  and just the normal function that's fine", "duration": 3.217, "start": 0}
{"text": "but maybe it's", "duration": 0.74, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called", "duration": 6.868, "start": 0}
{"text": "maybe it's hard t", "duration": 1.876, "start": 0}
{"text": "no that's right so maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square just normal remote control", "duration": 6.678, "start": 0}
{"text": "just think about it we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting so there's some more things we have uh another thirty minutes so then we're going to meet again so you know what you have to what you have to do", "duration": 14.932, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah no maybe not not uh that's not a f that's something for for for yeah that's not for you", "duration": 7.211, "start": 0}

{"text": "like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer", "duration": 8.9, "start": 0}

{"text": "fold open where you can see uh more options i think", "duration": 3.644, "start": 0}

{"text": "well you can um", "duration": 1.823, "start": 0}
{"text": "have uh the basic things on the same place like on off button on top and the", "duration": 7.05, "start": 0}
{"text": "t v  channels one two three four as a block and then the volume uh obviously on t on top", "duration": 6.55, "start": 0}

{"text": "right", "duration": 0.565, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so this is on the working design which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting", "duration": 12.836, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions the user", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t v  and also we talked about um", "duration": 6.21, "start": 0}
{"text": "a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t v  and it would send sort of signal to the remote", "duration": 6.59, "start": 0}
{"text": "where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is", "duration": 3.49, "start": 0}
{"text": "so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote um input which would probably be buttons", "duration": 6.4, "start": 0}
{"text": "although um we just talked about voice recognition processor to take the information um", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "something to transmit it to the t v  and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal", "duration": 6.78, "start": 0}
{"text": "and have an output like possibly a beep or a vibration and also you need a sender", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "for location signal which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t v ", "duration": 6.46, "start": 0}
{"text": "or stick it on their wall", "duration": 1.02, "start": 0}
{"text": "and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works power comes from the battery goes to the chip", "duration": 6.749, "start": 0}
{"text": "um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the t v ", "duration": 6.77, "start": 0}
{"text": "and then for the location function you would have a sender on the t v  which would output some sort of signal", "duration": 6.65, "start": 0}
{"text": "um we could use i r  but we'd probably wanna use radio instead that signal would go to a receiver", "duration": 6.62, "start": 0}
{"text": "which it would process it and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up", "duration": 5.02, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh battery for the energy source that way you wouldn't", "duration": 6.17, "start": 0}
{"text": "have to plug it in um a button pad for input um we can purchase a", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "pre made chip which will handle all the processing stuff i r  transmitter to communicate to the t v  that's just sort of standard", "duration": 6.83, "start": 0}
{"text": "um so most t v s have an i r  receiver probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself", "duration": 6.35, "start": 0}

{"text": "remote is like actually in front of the t v  it's not gonna work um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell", "duration": 6.1, "start": 0}
{"text": "phone sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably", "duration": 5.87, "start": 0}
{"text": "it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote", "duration": 6.42, "start": 0}

{"text": "um on the t v  or on the phone um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me i think that's what the phone has i mean when you need to find your phone you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever", "duration": 14.281, "start": 0}

{"text": "the best function for the user so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet", "duration": 6.54, "start": 0}

{"text": "you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way", "duration": 6.38, "start": 0}

{"text": "keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum and also things like", "duration": 6.11, "start": 0}
{"text": "is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough", "duration": 6.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to", "duration": 2.92, "start": 0}
{"text": "do some research about i would about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing um but basically", "duration": 6.36, "start": 0}
{"text": "we need to make sure that it turns on and off the t v  does it have like capacity to change the channels um", "duration": 6.85, "start": 0}

{"text": "just i mean i like the one on the right better just because it does have fewer buttons uh but i mean i think we sh can sort", "duration": 6.28, "start": 0}

{"text": "okay okay alright", "duration": 1.908, "start": 0}

{"text": "um okay", "duration": 1.764, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.725, "start": 0}

{"text": "s", "duration": 0.714, "start": 0}
{"text": "um", "duration": 0.996, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so okay let's see if i can i think still though", "duration": 6.55, "start": 0}
{"text": "it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know like 'cause if you just have like one menu button", "duration": 6.73, "start": 0}
{"text": "that works like with a", "duration": 1.7, "start": 0}
{"text": "you know or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the t v ", "duration": 5.7, "start": 0}

{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.804, "start": 0}
{"text": "it seems like that would be hard though i mean like because unless you know yeah just 'cause i wouldn't i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button yeah b yeah", "duration": 15.044, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.694, "start": 0}
{"text": "that sort of like joystick flat touch thing yeah", "duration": 4.02, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah i think that's an interesting idea 'cause it's cool it's it's funny like you f like i just i don't have an ipod but", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}
{"text": "like i you know i just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you", "duration": 6.15, "start": 0}
{"text": "just figure out how to use it quite easily like it's not that hard you know", "duration": 3.08, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and it is yeah it is really but do you need a screen then do you have to have a screen then", "duration": 5.268, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah okay yeah yeah okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button", "duration": 6.766, "start": 0}
{"text": "like a disc", "duration": 0.993, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah it's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad", "duration": 4.731, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.567, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah and then", "duration": 0.964, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so like it's like a little part of the circle that", "duration": 4.174, "start": 0}
{"text": "or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can", "duration": 3.348, "start": 0}
{"text": "zap okay", "duration": 1.3, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to okay", "duration": 4.852, "start": 0}
{"text": "well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like", "duration": 3.796, "start": 0}
{"text": "i mean like okay 'cause so", "duration": 1.828, "start": 0}
{"text": "i dunno i guess okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise that that means you're gonna go up the channels and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down but then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where", "duration": 14.804, "start": 0}
{"text": "like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way that's that way and volume is up and down", "duration": 8.82, "start": 0}
{"text": "it just", "duration": 0.668, "start": 0}
{"text": "it just kno the ipod knows s", "duration": 2.337, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want", "duration": 4.164, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay that's what i mean okay", "duration": 1.781, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up go up and down", "duration": 4.876, "start": 0}
{"text": "it's like a b", "duration": 0.792, "start": 0}
{"text": "like", "duration": 0.592, "start": 0}
{"text": "i think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod but the only thing is like ipods are so expensive like it has to be is that part of yeah i dunno i dunno you don't think so okay", "duration": 11.86, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.992, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah i'm thinking we could if if we're hav so ba i mean but an ipod just has that circle thing you know", "duration": 5.54, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah well like since it just has the circle thing you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape like it could be a cool sort of you know because it could be circular you know or something weird like that just", "duration": 14.221, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.66, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.564, "start": 0}
{"text": "so okay this is just for t v  it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with", "duration": 4.948, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah so how do you switch", "duration": 2.168, "start": 0}
{"text": "okay", "duration": 0.67, "start": 0}
{"text": "so like if we had that", "duration": 1.508, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah", "duration": 0.9, "start": 0}
{"text": "that's true yeah so i know i'm not c really clear on what", "duration": 3.496, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah yeah", "duration": 1.025, "start": 0}
{"text": "so you'd have to have like i think you would have to have like a function switch button you know somewhere so like you can you're either on t v  you're on d v d  or you're on v c r  or you're like so", "duration": 9.828, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but i mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc the touch pad", "duration": 6.355, "start": 0}
{"text": "yeah but it it would be", "duration": 1.674, "start": 0}
{"text": "so but i'm saying like does it make sense to have like some kind of a button so like you're if you're on t v  like you can switch", "duration": 6.25, "start": 0}
{"text": "channels but then if uh if you're on d v d  then like the channel bu like the", "duration": 6.12, "start": 0}

oh
okay
so just f um
so this is our agenda you're f you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me
uh i didn't oh yeah
so these are the
so these are the um last notes we i made if anything doesn't look right just say it to me then i don't have to put it in the report
okay but it's still possible uh uh financially so if you want to it's okay
okay just
slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls
maybe that's better
yeah that's that's a very good point
yeah
okay so this is okay
okay so that's uh i'll just have a look how much that is but um okay for the okay no you have a different chip for speech recognition so
so i already calculated that and it's still in the budget so it's okay
so you can show your prototype if you want to
okay cool
okay
mm
so how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone
yeah speech recognition just only one button to say it's on or off
so you can put it on the back as well if you want to
okay
yeah you can put it separate
okay
and do you still can do you still can choose what colour kind of colour you want how do you want to implement that just on the maybe on the second level as well
okay just draw draw the second level because we need that as well
yeah as well just make make a just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something
yeah
no no just on down there so uh
just uh if you s
yeah y maybe yeah
for the bottom
no you gotta slide it
yeah it's right

yeah
you want to save that file as well
the drawing
doesn't really matter just just uh

yeah
yeah

yeah
or we just make it three buttons all the colours on it just red yel uh red green and
that's that's very easy yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
no ma on on o on the on the
yeah
just make it
yeah just put it on those extra f extra function as well
oh just three stages you yeah that's okay
yes that's to remember
yeah but that's that's uh
that's a functionality for the television
okay
yeah but you have to search every time again that's what what happening if you do it like that but it's still the television that has to do that
no that's what the television does
okay it's cool
yeah that's fine
is this prich pretty much it yeah
it's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway
yeah okay cool
mm mm mm mm mm
yeah i don't know what this means but i think we just evela evaluated this one
oh okay you made some criteria okay cool
okay
you have some usability criteria or okay
look and feel
okay
okay
uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea it quite beautiful it's
we are actu we are the
flashy
but uh
it's black
yeah yellow light do we have yellow light no not really but it's possible it's
yeah different colours this is
oh the same as th th the cover but also th the light behind it
no no make them no just make them black or grey or something
yeah
yeah just give it a one it's okay it's perfect i think it's just what you want or not
okay just give it a two
yeah
no no it's only on the number behind the numbers and uh
that as well yeah
yeah but that's unnecessary
yeah
it doesn't make
no yeah
but yeah mayb okay
yeah just only yeah that's right
so
yeah that's how i think
ye
yeah this it is a one it's okay it's cool
this is a difficult one because we we don't yeah we don't know it about the
uh it's it's very easy to use but uh the second layer is not easy to use it's that's
no
but the rest of it is very easy because there are so so n
so it is learnable um f i i in the first place it's very easy to use and i think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device
but yeah
okay just easy to use is very cool so just give it a two
no but definitely better much better than uh than uh than avera average yeah
okay
slide is not n is is not new no i already have a
uh i already have a v c r  and it's about from nineteen eighty eight and they all have a slide in it so that's not new yeah
that's cool yeah for a uh for a f
there are no games on it that's that's it's not a one it's a two again but
if you have
yeah oh yeah that's right rechargeable
yeah just draw it afterwards
if you can you save it on the same in the same map as the other ones in the the project uh map
yeah mm hmm
uh save as no that's not in the project
oh yeah okay smart board yeah but this one
this one is not yet in the oh oh


but you still have to draw the resi the recharger okay and new features so we give it a two or also again a one no i think i if you have games on it then then you give you have a one but not
no just so it's still a two
targeted audience uh we are the targeted audience do we like it
yeah but l younger than forty so we we are exactly the targeted group
i think so yeah you get the fancy things for younger people and you get the the aesthetic things for older people so you want
yeah you get different colours
so
oh
so that's eleven
it's yeah it is one point eight three
oh yeah that's still
yeah maybe we have to skip that one
okay
so i just got a financial um

you s saved it or
no
okay let's have a look at this one here the production cost of it if i forgot anything just say it to me
it just is a battery yeah there are some that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list but okay so i think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's twelve point three euros
so this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker
so that's both
yeah and single curved curved
no that's not on the list but that shouldn't be
probably i just the b the button supplements i didn't i d i was wondering if this special colour maybe was i'm not sure
see it's i think it's okay like this
it's hard to say but maybe we have to um yeah okay special colour you can skip this one because it's all quite normal we get different ones that's all
so you can put a recharger in it as well but this is expensive the sample speaker
yeah
yeah that's included
yeah no okay so this is uh pretty much it this
so i just want you yeah we just made it so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh
for everything together
okay
we can do some discussion about this was there room for creativity
paul was there room for crea creativity
yeah
yeah
okay so the leadership
was there a leadership and
okay
what do you have to say about that
i dunno

yeah i know
okay next one uh team work um the the third meeting i think that one was pretty
hard we were not all we were not um agree with every not agree with
we're not finished
yeah
yeah finance
but the teamwork was okay
yeah
'kay
yeah what i have to say about uh means the smart board is okay digital pen is horrible i dunno if you use it but if you want to download it to your computer it's doesn't work no
yeah
it's the same for the presenta for the presentations you can do it from here that's much easier than standing there and so you've
yeah
yeah like
okay
i think yeah okay
so we made it in time and we made a remote control

in the budget yeah
i don't know what it mean just
for remote control probably no for the project
yeah but it's for the next team we don't have to do that
yes i think just i just write a final report
no we have only
four minutes left uh it's okay
okay

you have to save everything you know that huh
okay yeah
it's not saved yet
so
our beautiful drawing
are we doing the the speech recognition because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well
okay yeah well then then we're gonna put it in
yeah just uh we have to design the inside then but it should be uh
it's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well
okay so when you have a lot of room inside so you can make it very easy to use 'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it
no yeah we're gonna use the advanced chip then
advanced chip was for uh spee yeah
okay
good
together
i'll give comments
speech recognition
um i didn't have a specification of that but um i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something um so i've
yes you need options to configure it and after that you don't need 'em anymore
yeah you can put 'em all on the back that's for sure
that's uh
we also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons but
you have a lot of room if you can slide it open
you yeah i know i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something so but it's enough room
uh well well the main the main zap buttons are most central
that was the the most important thing so uh the best place the best reach place um on off buttons text buttons mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are easy to find
um the on off button is a bit bigger uh so it stands out that way you don't have to make it red 'cause it's
will uh will show up
uh scrollwheel is on the left side it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel as far as i know
yeah
okay yeah they
yeah okay that's that's below that then it's uh twelve buttons
yeah okay just we just missed that but um i'll just uh
i'll get back to later f the form well we've taken that from the ipod other popular technical device so um should be popular
um
the f uh the buttons creating uh if you
that or all round shapes not uh rounded corners
so that you know you get a bit round feeling
um we'll use hard plastic since that allows us to use uh two d  buttons uh non rubber buttons
colour changeable well and um the backlight thing the thing that lights up we have decided uh in the the channel buttons there's a little uh colour around it
and also in the num pads there's also colour light behind it
so when you pre
yeah
we're going to implement yeah mm just a little
yeah
yeah i um to your video device
yeah
is i ah okay
um slides i think it's
you can do it that it claps open but i think that's not solid enough if that breaks then you're screwed
so it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open um
uh i the the speech functions buttons
menu button
with uh maybe uh arrows
so you can uh
scroll in the navigate the menu
um
i think we can even put a we have one for the zero and one for the
for the more digit uh channels so you have one left for the right the video
channel play station etcetera that's used pretty often
if you have a play station mm you use it every day

that was it
uh
it doesn't really matter that's yeah well we don't have any uh hmm what else uh menu buttons with arrows
s just uh like um i think it's best if we do
mm where do we have
or there
like on the normal uh like this
the menu button yes
well we don't have any anything on how many buttons speech requires so you can't redesign it
yep
just press it once the colour should uh switch press again the colour switch again maybe
yep
yeah maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel that it is volume
i just uh the volume logo
yeah
yeah we have that on the the text button
uh why not
no whoa
i think um yeah the three stages yes
no it doesn't have to turn it off
just don't
yeah
i dunno if
yeah i think as well but uh yeah
yeah in thi the the remote control in the
the chip
yeah that's true
so yeah um do we need to fix that or
just like your telephone hard plastic
i think just on the buttons if you do it abo above or below it takes uh more space
i don't think the space is worth it
mm
okay well i think we do if it's really uh if you can if you can get the ipod look then it's beautiful i think
hmm
um basic colours um yeah well you didn't say maybe um company colours
black
a bit a bit of yellow
not not not yellow but just a bit of light yellow
like white also ni or uh always nice
just um
yes
yeah grey just dark grey i think
well we have changeable fronts so
so
yeah
it's hard to decide for us but yeah
it it's at least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls
yeah
mm not needed
yeah not needed i think
yeah
what do i think is necessary necessary item
of course it's reachable
okay maybe just some light uh to to light it all up so you can see what's really there not just not re on the buttons or something just a green light or some blue light
to light it all up
yeah
well yeah uh semi transparent
yeah w we've done a a lot of detail in light so
yeah
yeah
so i think it's easy to use but and learnable is a bit
well y just uh f
yeah i think it's very clear what it all does
yes
but the second parts uh like speech etcetera that will be harder to learn
it's yeah it's
device
okay
maybe three then learnable's
yeah okay yeah
yep true
then a two
and the scrollwheel backlights slide
but also slide that buttons come out as well okay
yes
different colours so
yeah
that would and we didn't uh
but then we also have the the home station we are forgetting about that now but
we don't recharge
but that's more like uh now
i don't know
uh
just save save as

okay
yeah it is
uh untitled yeah it doesn't matter save
n
mm i think we followed the latest trends
oh right well uh fruit and vegetables yeah you can different front uh
this is a a power indicator so you can see how far it's charged up
to call um
okay
no no i want that in
yeah th the speaker is very small as well right
yes uh
yeah we can uh
um different fronts but standard front won't be yeah
yeah
this
oh them is that uh included in the twelve euro or okay then we then we need to use it
yeah
damn solar cells are uh expensive
okay
mm uh i yeah i think so i think uh everyone uh already so
i think we uh discussed a lot of things about it so
of course there was
yeah
one leader to
check the time etcetera
so more like a secretary
uh i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time i think that was the m biggest problem like uh the prices if we knew that before we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker
yeah and if you had uh fifteen euros then we would it we had to
yeah
i think uh everyone listen to each other like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design
it was just doesn't work well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with if it worked really well just not work too slow yeah more accurate
yeah it's i it should be more accurate
and uh i think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse from where you're sitting
not just pointing out on it
yeah
no use to draw on the board itself it's just slows down
yeah
yeah even harder to draw like this than black board style
yeah
you cou you could draw on it but not as main function
we did it
new ideas found
oh
i just think if we uh
i dunno
for remote control a favourite for your text
that's for
yeah this this is just the idea phase the
yeah
details uh

quite early
oh what do we have to do now do we uh
i thought we were done at four o'clock
yep
mm we can do it afterwards so

yeah i found it as well


one two three
four five six seven cameras
mm not bad
so that was it
this is
the old versions
they went for uh
for a universal device yeah but also a different device
then an l c d  uh would be handy
yeah and touch screens for all our stuff yeah i do agree with that
yeah tu dum
english is not so hard by the way
well leader
project manager
you do yeah you have to make a choice
wow that's pretty quick
uh uh um
you have to decide
it's the lower one
no no the upper one is the bomb yes

i knew it
no that's too much work
come on
i challenge you
no you gotta use the magic pen
hmm
what if
i put one
there
we'll see
i don't agree
yeah you had two choices
that's gonna be draw
or not
i'll put it here you are going to put it there then
it's a difficult choice either here or there
ugly
oh a pen
yeah but
then do it correctly
stupid the l c d  screen
what
okay i'm going to guess what you're drawing
no no the new one
uh they just don't save it
a house
yeah you have to use the pen s stupid
no not everything
pen select select pen
okay
it's a house
a plant
oh yeah i can know it
it's a
okay that makes it easier
i think i know no wrong
i think i know what you're trying to draw but it's wrong already
yeah you missed the right side

no you're wrong you're wrong


see where you're wrong now
the entrance
alright
you're correct

yeah but i think oh no you made another mistake
no i w okay i'm not that whiny but uh there was a big hole here as well and there as well
that's a kinda big mistake
warning finish meeting now
guys i think we have to finish the meeting
uh
what does it say
come on

yep
oh you gotta finish
over there in your own room i'm gonna be so lonely
mm i'll clean that up later

what's that
okay
okay
oh okay yeah
yeah and or are we making a slide open like underneath or fold open i don't know
it's probably better
yeah s like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions
yeah
think that's better
the
yeah i i think so i don't know
ah okay
yeah
yeah it's let's do it together okay
yeah we just made a word file
with the basic
elements
uh the look and feel model uh well the form the case um
as drawn there simply a square with uh round corners so
that's basically it uh the material should be hard plastic
uh colour changeable and also transparent and colour and transparent or just transparent i don't know um then the elements
uh we have
the functions are just basic like uh i've pointed them here mute function on off function text functions this uh switch channel and this is the
the num pad and the logo is over here and the mic
and the scrollwheel no you operate that with your pointing finger so you hold it like this in your right hand and
uh i dunno
yeah maybe maybe uh you have to configure it
yeah or or on the slide function i don't know well we haven't had time to design that the slide pad
yeah
um the position yeah you write uh you wrote this so
yeah but it's not uh impossible to use it if you're left handed so y because you can use your thumb then
mm yeah
yeah okay
just so you get that
yeah
yeah these are just basic functions so all the non basic are in
okay
um
okay maybe we use this button for the
yeah
a second level like a a new blank one or or just here okay
yeah
so what do we need
yeah just
god damn it
so this is the

extern or something
so here are multiple speech buttons i don't know how many
i don't know the functions okay what else
what else
uh menu
uh with arrows
like a normal um
yeah with in the middle um a menu button okay
yeah okay
we can put those here
so did we miss anything
okay
oh wh here
okay
yeah or th or the
yeah
yep
yeah but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext you just switch it off and then
well w we thought of a text button and if you press it again you get the the the
through view yeah b but but if you're in the second stage the third stage is switch teletext off so you can switch back from second to w first
okay okay
yeah mm nee uh no if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred page seven hundred to the television th th th if you switch it on
th i
yeah i dunno okay
yeah those memory functions
yeah was uh this logo for uh volume okay
so that's it
mm no no yeah just hard plastic so
uh i think just um
yeah but
i think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons
in the bottom
no evaluation is
yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste
and what colours should the buttons be
but can you change those too with uh the switch
okay
yeah it's ju so subjective
one more thing are w are we changing uh or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too or n no back light yeah
and and the switch channel is uh there is a back light too
yeah
hmm
yeah just backlight not not the buttons and th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons but behind the buttons so the buttons are just grey
okay
no but you don't have to use that and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer that's th that's the main thing that's so good about it
well i think it is
so so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function
mm uh
the normal and the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know
yeah
the speech function and the colour colour

mm it's pretty new i think
speech is new
yeah
yeah we didn't draw that too but
yeah that's just a normal th s simple thing
well it's a already in the folder l like number seven
i think it is

no i think it is
okay
mm two i think
yeah
we've got a one for fancy look and feel and that's what attracts the young audience so
think that's a two or a one
yeah but s it that's basically not not handy and i don't thi i don't see
yeah
yeah
no
yeah you could make a a front
a front that's that's like uh like a banana or something
like a a f banana kind of front
no
yeah
eleven divided by six
we're not too hard on ourselves
okay
okay
yeah but uh we have to make a speaker then too if you want to make it beep
but we can we can do it uh underneath the logo
if you do uh
yeah okay
mm okay
but uh is uh uh
okay
but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or
can we make that for uh h twenty cents

yeah
yeah it's four
it's kind of weird that we we get this information now afterwards because

sure
beautiful
yeah m if we got a high mark for um
uh innovativeness or innovativity
then there we probably have been creative
yeah
huh

no i think yeah
just normal discussion i think not
one leader or something
yeah and make notes
yeah
yeah w we had so much information that we get through email and just
yeah
yeah th that's weird
hmm hmm yeah
so we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right
yeah
yeah
yeah i if if it would be faster it would be great
yeah
yeah and p just point with a mouse
yeah
just old fashioned kinda blackboard style but you might as well do it in normal computer style
yeah yeah
and it's far too slow this way
no


what's that
hmm
yeah but still you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this because we don't have any sizes and
yeah but it you can't possibly do that in such a short time i think
yeah just brainstorming basically

so are we finished
okay yeah
oh okay
it's now quarter past three so




yeah now we can look at this
we're probably not supposed to look at this but
yeah from the previous group
the touchscreen yeah
yeah
hmm
here are the
basic functions in here the selecting dev devices
hmm
no
yeah this one

hmm
this is a very interesting design
well it has a l c d  i think
and what else do we have


yeah everything
it wants to know what we do in our spare time
warning finish meeting now
warning warning
okay
boom boa ring bing
fill in the questionnaire
what now
okay
no more chit chat
yeah
okay
oops
mm hmm
means

okay

just just one thing now um y you need to have more uh one two th you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine but you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes
okay but
it's rather important
okay
ah
okay there is one uh function i use uh daily and it's not on the basic functions it's uh to switch to uh uh your scart play station or uh d v d  player that function must be
yeah maybe or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions
and h how does the second level come out uh it slides uh along
from from the uh beneath
menu
scart
uh yeah
and so y you keep you keep one you have one left yes
yeah it's a f basic uh
yeah to navigate

mm okay
maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh leds
uh and and you can hold it you can hold it and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons
okay
okay yeah th yeah if we have enough place uh then we can do that
colour buttons and then we choose green uh blue and red or okay
okay that's uh um
it
some text uh buttons
yeah but
there's one there's one text button i
there's one text button i prefer that's the one uh that you use if you search for a page uh like seven hundred
uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred you will switch to your television and back to text
do you do you did you think of that
ex yeah yeah
the sta the state you
yeah
no just remember where it was it it doesn't uh uh clear the the page
if you if you turn teletext on you you set the seven hundred and you turn it off then
the next time you turn it on it still stays on seven hundred but maybe it's not the way
mm that's maybe one thing we can discuss about
mm most new t v s do uh collect all the pages
but uh not not every every television so
yeah i i thought about one thing uh the buttons uh from which material are they now
okay because um if you use it a couple of years some uh sometimes
the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away are uh and maybe we can
write the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on on the buttons
well yeah that's too much place
okay just leave it just leave it
yeah and i
the most time
yeah with rubber buttons yeah okay
okay fine
yeah i made some criteria uh so we can uh ev evaluate our model i d d d i don't think if it's right that shall show it
mm hmm uh no uh all criterias we just argue about uh
oh
yeah
evaluation crit
yeah evaluation presentation
it's not in
uh d it doesn't matter um it only had two pages or something
um well i looked in the reports um from the
marketing strategy or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and
uh the market the italians uh how they think about it and
the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users
and that kind of stuff i made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from one
to zero we sh we we we can give it uh a number and then we can give ourself an average
for our
um model and this these are all i i i found or i wrote down and um we have to discuss about if we give it a one or a seven uh
yes yeah the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look and feel is uh the the
the outside uh beautiful uh like the ipod or something and fancy's more like the mm uh f
the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff the leds
yes and and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of the basic colours are black or green or yellow or you haven't thought about
ho how do we make uh
black and yellow can
black white maybe
uh
because um
okay so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful beautiful is uh really subjective uh because it has to do lots with the colours
changeable fronts so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful
yeah
a two okay
the fancy look and feel that's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons okay and we can change the colours so that's uh really fancy i think so
slide panel
oh you mean th this here
it's pretty cool if you slide it open it lights up that's that's really fancy but i don't know if it's reachable
then we do it
yeah but
okay
okay fine so i i think it's very fancy so i'll give it a
yeah and you can uh also choose your light so
i think it's one
okay next learnable easy to use
yeah we shall test it but uh
yeah
learnable it's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control because because
i think i think the scroll wheel uh it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your hands
it's not to use the scroll wheel i think uh you must uh seek for it and up or down or
uh then the re
yeah
okay
okay
but
yeah but we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things huh and maybe we
uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls
so we h we have speech uh the scroll wheel and um the the
the slide you must slide it
and that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls 'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use because easy to use comes after learnable i i think it a three or something
oh okay new features techno technological innovative
the speech function is new the scrollwheel and the slide uh i think the slide is pretty new
uh i only saw it in a telephone not in an remote control
okay
okay and the the the lightning is that new the lighting's new scrollwheel speech
yeah different fronts for a remote control i think that's new too
so we have a pretty new uh
it's it's it's not not l c d  or something
uh oh
home station

yeah

uh all the the seven uh all the seven
no we are not extraordinary new or something tha tha that
no we we we searched for uh um a young group audience beneath f forty yes
yeah but did we reach um with our uh style the targeted audience th that's my question
yeah
yeah um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh that's that's that's this question
yeah this so we targeted it
but we didn't follow the latest trends
tha these are the only latest uh trends i uh get on my computer
uh yeah th so we had we uh have uh a fruit uh
oh yeah but spongy will never be
so we give ourself a three or something

okay
that's uh
what's the average
a perfect score no i don't know

and and you need n uh a button to call it to let it beep
call
that's yeah but it
no we need that that's usable that's really usable
it's uh
yeah
i did save it
that's fine
come on it's perfect uh twelve point three point three

special form yeah
four it's four euros
yeah so we are

okay
yes

or a different style
yeah
we could make a lot of different uh remote controls so it's creativity
who was the leader
yeah yeah we were not finished
uh
yeah because
the prices uh could be twenty euros or something now and then
yeah
yeah uh everybody could speak their uh opinion and uh
yeah
digital pen or
yeah the drawings are are hard to make i think
precise

digital pen


new ideas
for for for

to gather or to uh
work together uh or new ideas for


no for the prototype new ideas

hmm
i should take some pictures uh
yes

let's play minesweeper
ti din ti din


i'm breaking a world record here
oh shit
we've got a problem paul
yes
no it's your choice
tu dum
just pick one
what's this a bomb or not a bo this the bomb
wrong
shit i knew it
four in a row
uh
is that previous work

oh that's so stupid
no that doesn't work
that's stupid
okay
mm
sorry
too bad
yeah then i put it there no one wins
it's just the same as normal
okay
stupid design stupid
'kay wait i'm going to draw something and you must y
okay blank
oh
um
i know uh
oh
pen
no it's only you can know it
it's uh very hard to draw
mm
it's very
fuck f
a little bit maybe but
yeah
okay the entrance is uh more to the left
okay but but but i think this part

oh yeah there are a lot of mistakes because the walls are thick like this
oh that's true uh here yeah they're walking behind the walls
'kay this is a hard one
okay
che che che che
tu dumm
uh
this is that's my new interface
that's a uh edited smiley
tom ti dom uh
i don't think they are concrete proposals
no
yeah this makes sense
yeah it's up to them i guess uh
up to us well i mean they they can switch later they can switch later
pirette next
who
so i don't know we spent quite some time at the last meeting and t to decide this and now we are just
of course but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them so i don't think it's a good idea yeah m
w i i i don't mind going into this office
no

oh why not
yeah
no

maybe we can put pierrette and her t two two p h d  students into one room
um yeah mayb maybe the other one would be more convenient if we are all working on the same project so we are close by
mm
agnes

yeah
why
okay w w why don't we move maria to this to where to the office i'm supposed to be and i can go with nancy
if you think that
but is this about windows or is it about it it it must be functional if you and martin work on the same project then
yeah we can each other yeah
i agree but the setup is pretty good now so bruno is not on and he's sharing um office uh i'm not sharing somebody with i work on the same project
uh um yeah

martin and you yeah
yeah what is it now
bu s somebody has to be
well will there be wireless in the building i mean if there are reception hours so somebody could move to the reading room and have people
well isn't this the case doesn't everybody has one no

mm
no hmm i have no problem with that
um
yeah who does anyway
so maybe you and bruno should take this office
yeah that's a good idea
and it's not very healthy either yeah
mm
suggestion if possible we could move me and yalina to the office where andrei and nancy are now
no i i just it's just more convenient if i'm closer with my
the partners of my project

she's the heart of the
it's not kitchen


well it's it's ideal for nancy she is just very close to the lifts
excellent yeah
so when exactly are we supposed to move
three weeks so they've set up everything wiring uh internet or what's the sta the status right now
s
well there are lots of walls we can put posters on
yeah we don't want to micro manage things yeah
can you mail a copy of that to everybody
not really
yeah
yeah yeah
suzanne for example
mm hmm
so what do you think for uh
susan and maggie for example the
the rooms for one person
naturally
yeah to

i would say not together in a three it's quite a lo yeah yeah
some
just yeah
yeah it's quite dark
yeah it would be nicer

finally you think
yeah i agree it's uh

you you said that there is electricity
in the
well let's uh how we can uh fill the three person rooms
uh how we ge who we gonna put in the three person rooms i mean we have now a two three person rooms left and um
yeah yeah mm we do mm


so where were we uh pierrette uh andrei nancy
yeah why not
all two mariannes or
and you too okay so we need a
yeah i'd like to have a view to the mountains but well
yeah
well that's that will do but uh
yeah well f yeah it's uh yeah old town is as well as well yeah
that's alright yeah yeah and that's good because there are pirette
marianne and nikos they are on the other side of the corridor so it's yeah
who is left um who
and
yalina ya yalina would be good and actually she is working for the same project as well
with beautiful laughter
and anyway martin is just a fifty per cent
okay
that's all

how i how it looks like
yeah you can
ah
yeah uh that was my question
yeah i mean with whom you'd you'd to with whom you'd like to work in the same office i mean is it important to have someone uh from the same project or um
yeah we can skive but you're gonna disturb all the people
we're gonna disturb all the people by skiving all the time

yeah that's for sure
with
yeah i yeah i dunno you were saying that uh maria and nancy doesn't fit together in the same
so what you say if you change the office uh i don't know and you work with nancy or uh
what do you yeah i dunno
for example
yeah
sounds okay
what do you say
sorry
no what's bothering you
i thi i think
and now you are you are changing your mind all the time
yeah but if you work with the people like pirette and marianne uh
well at mm

uh well
pirette is having quite a
unadvantaged situation because there are marianne and bruno who are having uh reception hours so it's gonna be a qui yeah so it's quite a
traffic there i would say

no
so well of course if they put uh

the aim having a room room for reading or
yeah
people
well you can you als already speak quite well finnish so we might get along yeah yes i will
it's easy for them to
find the people
it only goes on yalina
yeah we have to from the other side of the
but well
yeah the people having students
yeah if we change the
three people
pirette marianne david david
with here and uh
yeah we got it
w with the mount ah my mountains yes i got the mountains
and bathrooms are nearby yeah


fifty per cent yeah
yeah looks good
yeah i think too i'm quite happy with it

yeah
yeah but it's quite logical to have the for the professors one person rooms i think
for the yeah
we can skive as you said
yeah
person rooms mm hmm
and the projects they're they are quite well grouped actually now
and well gisella she is kind of
in the middle
yeah department
in the reading room that would be good
oh it's not ah it's
yeah good coffee
yeah quite strong strong good coffee

uh yeah
yeah
if you late uh you work late yeah and you drink uh coffee yeah
is there actually a smoking uh area somewhere
not for me but
but we okay we have the terrace still on the sixth floor or uh how how no not at all they have to go down yeah
yeah yeah
and susan maggie as well
yeah i think it's okay let's see what the the other ones say
three weeks
okay
my boxes ah yeah
that might be a good idea
well mai mailing lists
of course you can mail em yeah if you have something
ah okay yeah a posters okay that's kind of thing yeah yes
or in front of the reading room or
yeah
mm
no more special
wishes
yeah you know
no it's kind of we should maybe find a method to do stuff like i don't know choose one parameter
the first parameter to choose people to choose where to put people like i dunno maybe permanent staff and non permanent staff we know that professor will stay for a long time we uh we don't know for the other
so
maybe that could be the first parameter to take into account not just to have this dis
yeah and have this discussion every two years
because it's
you know
make sense for everyone so we can choose where to put uh i would say the the the
three first one of the list yeah
yeah yeah and yeah
mm and maybe the two other senior andrei and nancy
and then yeah
mm
yeah that could be an idea
yeah mm
yeah

can switch
yeah
which is
so we need to put pirette andrei and nancy do we want to the the question is now is do we want to put the three together or the three completely separate
with
other people
yeah yeah
some some yeah but few less than pierrette
so we have a
mm
yeah
um i just realised something the two people room in the middle which has only one windows

it's gonna be pretty hard to put two people inside that room
yeah
yeah except we yeah and near the photocopier
yeah
and what about the reading room
yeah but you i mean uh i think everybody is supposed to spend more
time in their office than in the reading room so we might think that it's better to have a more comfortable
office than a more comfortable reading room i don't know it change the plan of the morning i'm sorry
but i just realised that stupid architect put only one windows
who built this building do we know that
i dunno what do you think
yeah
yeah i know but in the last meeting nobody just
took attention at this one windows problem and i think it is one problem
yeah you too i can i can say the thing to you i'm sorry
the two people that's really welcoming and warming
yeah
what what what say it again
no no but the main problem we have the same number of place and the same number of people now yeah and uh i just noticed that we have this two people room
with only one windows yeah you don't mind to have
okay so nikos and you have to find yeah you have to find somebody agree to come with
you and it's not a question of you it's a question of windows
who would you put with you let's put a fifty per cent so
from the david yeah do you know david you will learn to know him
so david and nikos it's done
and with um pirette uh
andrei and nancy
how many p h d  student does she have
and me
yes i'm doing a p h d  yes officially um
so and can you put the the map again so we s see what happen
um
that's that might be a good idea to put pirette with two p h d  student whoever they are
which one
okay
so pirette and
the two mariannes
okay so wha put me with marianne and pirette it's alright
and we put marianne in front if she want to be
no on the room on the opposite oh no that's the old town view
pick a room is that alright is the old town view beautiful enough
mm yeah okay so marianne and who do you want to work with
nancy martin pirette no pirette is done
andrei yalina maria and agnes okay okay so put yalina with um
yeah
okay
and we have uh
now
do you think it's a good idea to put martin and andrei together since they are working on the same project
yeah and we might put martin and andrei and someone else in the three person room since the fifty per cent it's a good
okay
maria and nancy
that's really strange

so what do we think about that
mm hmm mm yeah
i think this project thing is not good thing
this project splitting i mean
splitting by project
yeah no but if you if if you split by project you put me in one person room
that's hard
could you say that again
okay
okay
so you just
you just move him or
the two groups you just
yeah
no
except coffee time and that's important project too but uh gossiping and stuff like that yes mm
yeah
and it's quite funny to to to hear other
activities around you and not always the same stuff
especially when it's activity that you don't understand or yeah
yeah
no that's quite nice
oh yeah
yeah yeah okay why not

i'm not totally convinced
i'm not convinced about this i dunno
yeah first of all no from the beginning i said the three person room it's quite i mean it's a disadvantage
and um
to change a little bit this disadvantage we put somebody fifty per cent in
three person room so we could do the same in the three person rooms but there is still this problem yeah
yeah
yeah it's here for working not not us but exactly
and you so there is no view
and pirette as well we uh all have uh reception hours
yeah
yeah
you can move with your desktop yeah
no
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
okay can we say that david uh is yeah instead of
okay but okay no because i was thinking of we can um
having these two office which are near to the lift
keep this office for reception people
if i can con we are pirette the two marianne and i are receivi and maggie and susan are receiving a lot of student so we
with the finnish for example if you want me
yeah so that's ki yeah yeah okay lopeta
yeah yeah uh that's nice to have a corner a student i mean a student area
you know what i mean yeah to find us and it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of
parade of student before the exams so if you work with me and you have this
agree with that
so and the photocopier is still
yeah
yeah
yeah
no but it's too far from
yeah
okay
yeah
that's quite good and then yeah
so we have a three windows' room with view everywhere aha
yeah
we close the door
yeah and
i think that's quite nice

and then and put david
in a two person office and why
no no the reason to put pirette and marianne marianne and i together is because of the noise we make by receiving students
and then the reason to put david in this office it's because yeah it's fifty per cent in a three
um
place office
um
that sounds nice no
and i think we do have the best office uh it's a kind of dictatorship decision but we are here to make a decision so
and agnes you're gonna sell this to the administrator
yeah so
the argument of student yeah you can also s oh yeah
yeah
yeah
is
yeah
yeah but we all work on different projects so we can't
what is the little square d you put oh a printer and the photocopier okay
that's quite fine
student reception
you
okay
no yeah that's fine
so the arguments are uh student reception
in one corner
yeah
the fifty per cent
staff
in the three
person room
yeah yeah
and um the two mm and the two professor is one single
yeah
centred
and since you nee you will meet the administrator can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere yeah or in that hall i mean the sixth floor there is no coffee machine on the sixth floor
no no um a vending machine
yeah but try
wi with good coffee italian one please
yeah
and herb tea
for the afternoon
h herb tea
for the afternoon yeah because with strong coffee i don't t sleep
yeah
yeah yeah mm
and do we know if there will be air conditioning
no no no there is no terrace on that building
so no we're not gonna change the plan only for the smokers
exactly as well
i think it's fine
okay is everyone happy with that
mm
wow
that's very professional yeah
hmm

uh can
can we think of putting a white board somewhere in the hall for general information
yeah
yeah but i mean you have a nice poster of the next conference you don't put it you know a a big board with
along one of the wall yeah
yeah
mm yeah
ooh
i think it's everybody's responsibility to find
if they prefer to be in front of back to window or whatever i mean if we start doing that not happy
we are all adults so i think we can all speak and
uh okay
i hope yeah
okay
okay
okay so now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it um does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just
go through people and start placing them and kind of discuss as we go along
nope
okay
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah give them like the most comfortable offices and
yeah
'cause a professor but he's only here half time so it's sort of a different situation
and he's a professor at but not in geneva he just does research in geneva
yeah
okay so let's
go through that first um
yeah and for susan probably yeah 'cause i think she prefers to have her own office
um okay any preferences to which one
'kay i put susan here for now
and then maggie in the other one
no it's up to us they're not here so
um okay
and then
yep
um
well pierrette has students and andrei and don't well does andrei s he teaches but okay
yeah
'cause also if we're gonna put people together by projects then there's no sense to put them together 'cause they all work on different projects
right
mm
yeah
'cause they'll fight for the window
what about moving gisella in there
if she's in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and okay she's not near the mailbox but
but it maybe more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people
but again one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it is is so that you have
you think

yeah
i don't know
or what if you put
what if we put the two people that are fifty per cent in that room yeah
but they are only here fifty per cent
so everyone has to go somewhere
and you also have one three person room with two windows
nikos volunteers

who you're taking with you

okay well 'kay so let's put david in there yeah
you'll meet him okay
so i'm just gonna
make a list on here of who we have
keep talking
with pierrette
okay so david nikos gisella maggie and susan are done
okay
yeah
okay should we be nice and give them three windows
okay
that won't get confusing
where here
oh here
would have to be here or the other three person room
pick a room
well she's not that far if she's like like in this one here
'kay so you want this one

mm
okay
yalina

yeah that could work
in room yeah
yeah
okay
mm
i guess i can go in there 'cause martin and i wor are working on the sort of the same thing
and that leaves
and nancy
yeah that's a weird combination
no it's not that it's just you've almost got like a project split
except that you don't because
nancy and maggie and i work on premindia parmenidy parmenidies and then andrei martin maria and i also work on
and sort of susan although the susan and maggie thing we can't really change
no
but then we should split the little party up
all on your own
hmm
see i would put it the other way i would put the room with martin in it in the two window room 'cause he's fifty per cent so then at least
the other two people get
put martin in the three person room with two windows
since he's fifty per cent
either way well i don't know for splitting up
people or
well i'm trying to optimise
i don't think it's necessarily so important to be in the same office with someone
if you're working on the same project
'cause you're too lazy to get up and walk next door
i don't know like right now i share an office with bruno we don't work on any projects together
yeah of course but i mean that's fine like i don't need to be in the same office with someone who works on or
someone who works on parmenidies
it's not like yeah
know anything about yeah you hear things out of context what
okay
i just can't really see them sharing an office i don't know why
or we put andrei and nancy to nancy together 'cause they're starting that new
project and then put maria with
me and martha i can see that working a bit better
hmm
i thought you were saying you didn't wanna be in a three person room first of all

yeah and put david but then you and nikos have the window problem which is why i still think we should put gisella in that room because
it's
she gets the window the whatever he's there for two months it's their problem yeah not for enjoying the view
so

yeah but if you put
so what if we
switch no
you have to have a computer with wireless
no well most of us first of all have desktop computers pick up your desktop and plus you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours
right like if people are actually using it as a reading room
yeah
can we say we're gonna move gisella here
and then
i think that gives us a little bit more flexibility to play with moving people around goes here
you were the first one on the list but if you wanna remove someone else
yeah
mm hmm so what if we put you with yeah will
you have okay so
i'm just putting yalina in so we don't
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
or do you wanna go somewhere else
here
you just don't photocopy
well you have the other
lift
the switch
with here
so like that and then move you to
that's what the plan was from the beginning
do you get the photocopying noise now we are all gonna come photocopy just to annoy you

okay
or did was the id
i should start start making full sentences
what about
i was thinking about moving pierrette and marianne into a two person office rather than a three person office
but
with andrei and nancy for example
no in a three person office because if they have reception
i know i thought you were saying that
pierrette should have a smaller office
or be in a smaller office because of reception or something or did i just completely misunderstand
okay
is because he's fifty per cent okay
okay that works
mm hmm

i'm going to try yes
'kay what arguments do i need
well we have the the group and students here although you still have susan and maggie over here
yeah
so it is sort of a well no it's not a project split
it's weird 'cause it kind of is and kind of isn't
because maria and martin and i work all work on the same project and then andrei and nancy work on the same project and pierrette n yeah
and yeah
okay let me just write down the arguments for why um
mm hmm
you just want a bigger window

happy
that's noise reduction

okay
now they are yeah
except for david but we can't do anything about that

you mean like
a little machine or a vending machine
'kay
the little machine i think would be harder to sell but
i will
nespresso
with the good strong coffee what did you say hot tea
oh herb tea

nope non smoking building
no they'll have to go down
and susan maggie close enough yeah
okay
yeah i think so
just checking if actually have everyone but i think we do
in was it what did i say three weeks
as far as i know yeah as far as i know basically we pack up one day the movers come take all our stuff put into the red boxes so when you get there the next day all your stuff is already in your office
and all the i p s and everything is set up they're trying
so we'll see make sure you label your boxes properly
um especially the marianne's
yeah so they won't confuse it get confused with the other marianne's boxes
uh we can try
i can ask them
but that's not really
um where
like along gisella's
yeah
okay so
along that bottom hallway somewhere
okay
anything else i need to ask them
'kay
i don't actually we may need to sort out
that's not healthy um who
i don't know if we need to sort out who sits where 'cause if they're gonna plug everything and set everything up
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah no no yeah
i just can't remember whether they're actually gonna set everything up for us or not but we can change it i guess
okay
that's it then save this
yep
not right now 'cause i'm not connected to the internet

but i will
okay
good we're done then
um so hi everyone thanks for coming to this meeting um well
as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving
and we are going to get more space so that's a very good piece of news uh but we also
have to find out how we use this space
so um if you want i'll just give a brief overview of what's happening
and then we can uh talk about well arranging these new uh the new office space
so um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh
show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space
so um well there is nothing much to say well you know how many of us are are present
and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location uh that's why
actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh
the unimail building so it's at the sixth floor and it's uh sort of contiguous rooms
as you you can all see from uh from here um so the the the one
p  two p  three p  means the the number of persons as you can see we have several corridor
um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person
rooms two person room and and three person rooms um actually i think
agnes did this nice drawing so she even put the the view so we have the old town on one side and the
mountains on the other two sides uh we have some bathrooms for us uh
and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down at uh the first
floor
well it's a bit difficult to say because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture
uh they are here so um well your your person your your question actually is answered maybe by the
third item so each person should get um well it's a sort of desk it's
made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with of course a chair uh a filing cabinet that goes
under the desk uh and well we can put hanging shelves over the the desks
so i'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two
person office but um we could try what's what should be said here i don't know if
well you i i will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them maybe it's
easier do you need something martin um i can keep this for you uh so it's
it's yeah you have a copy susan you too david i think so in fact there are more
places than people so we won't be that constrained uh as you know some of us and some of you
here actually martin and david are part time so it it's for the moment quite comfortable normally
we should even get an extra uh an extra place for you know temporary people coming to work
on uh on projects uh yeah i uh yeah i counted so we have um
fifteen pers physical persons and about uh sixteen
i think uh persons oh actually eighteen persons in the offices
exactly it so one of the issues uh here it's probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what had until now a lounge or reading room uh in one of the the offices so in one of the rooms
um i think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that so if we could do it then i think it would be much nicer um let me also uh st say something yep

yeah i i think so
mm hmm
well sixteen slots for fifteen people so it's still should be feasible
that's
yeah i think that's quite important to manage some space maybe we can think of yeah some two or three yeah for visiting people correct
mm hmm okay so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done so we also need
to to find the a spot for the photocopier the fax machine and the printer the fax you know is very
small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well ab this size
um okay the offices comes with white boards not very uh very important uh the furniture
that w each each person has and uh you have a list of people
so the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin
that that are thinking about uh for well about putting people i in these rooms um there is another
group that is also having discussions so the idea is that today we'll just try to f
start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it
uh ask the people you know your assistants for instance and at the next meeting we'll try to
to come with one solution uh the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation
so w
uh if i if we don't get these um well basically they are promised to us so uh do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh
yeah i i i think it's uh uh yeah
yeah i yeah that's one of the the problems i think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some
of the bigger rooms with four people one being temporary or or part time um
okay so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options
say the general uh well arrangement options do you think that we should put
people say according to projects for instance in in the table that um that
we have uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working
so how yeah mm hmm
oh actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms this we cannot really change i mean
at least not us it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance but what is absolutely
n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms so basically we are all the
permutations are possible at the moment
um
well what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy
so uh the other group is uh i don't think we have to see them as competitors but they are just trying to to find
another local optimum or l uh
uh
yeah yeah uh uh we yeah i i think that's yeah there is no real competition between the two but
we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are actually it's
it's i think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to
mm well you know find two two kinds of opinions yeah well we could have been eight h sitting
around here and and talking but i think it's it's more difficult
mm hmm
well
exactly i think so so today the goal is not to to find the solution today but to set some constraints and then
go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences obviously we won't be able to accommodate all
the the preferences but at least we'll find the most uh the most important ones
p s i think
mm hmm
yeah i think so that's one of the things i think we know that they have students we don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to
be alone or to well to be with their assistant or even with another person
working on the project so that would have been maybe yeah another solution is to ask everyone to
provide uh an arrangement but uh i think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to to work
out um so since all of you have a copy of the uh well of the drawing i think
for the next time m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names
on it but let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people
say by projects or just professor and assistant so what would be f say first your preferences
since let's let's start with us maybe today um what do you think about it would you prefer to be alone
would you prefer to be with your assistant you who are part time do you think you can come here
on a very w well regular schedule or is it part time but variable during the week
uh huh and since you're coming on the uh half time do you think you will be able to group your presence here say monday tuesday and wednesday morning or is it going to be m much more random

okay
yeah i think so too um so martin you are also uh half time and well the third person
is gisella i think it's quite clear that mm each person should have their own desk
and yeah it's no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk
yeah i think grouping
mm hmm
mm hmm
are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people okay
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
like cubicles
mm hmm
yeah i i i will try to find out whether we can separate i think for the moment the answer at least is no because
um it's not only well making a wall but also b mm making a new door so it's quite a lot of
uh of work but uh i will try to find this out for the next time um so at least for the moment
as you can see there are uh i can show them here on the screen so there are these two rooms on the left that
uh accommodate one person so at least some of the professors since you are four uh
could could go uh well could take these uh these rooms and quite a lot of rooms with two persons
uh how do you feel susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the
most involved in in the teaching
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah that's um that's true um okay um maybe we could s look a bit at
the projects do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same
project since they talk quite a lot of to each other
mm hmm okay
well yeah and some of the p h d  students will hopefully finish their p h d  at some point
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh huh
okay yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah well actually so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building as we now know
mm hmm
mm hmm so i think we need a
yeah and and i think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge which is a whole other topic
uh huh
um
yeah yeah for the moment actually i think only one slot would be fully free uh that is yeah
yeah that means one visitor at a time or one intern yeah that's mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah it's already in progress and you're you're working uh i think yeah w okay so one of the things i have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and
yeah i think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building
mm hmm
mm hmm and okay i'll try to find out and the other question is can we squeeze maybe four people in the uh or at least four places in the three three p  room
yeah hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space or um yeah
they don't have that many papers uh okay so that's uh i have to to ask so you don't really
feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by projects idea mm hmm
um
yeah exactly
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah they they can change
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i think that's that's going to be one of the the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences
either in staying with someone or in uh not staying um are you aware f
of any strong constraints right now
oh
okay yeah that's true so smoking is now um no longer a constraint
yeah
yeah that's the new regulation
uh on the balcony actually yeah normally
yeah mm hmm

mm hmm
o on the toilets or
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm yes martin said also for him and yeah especially for her yeah the in she's the interface so mm hmm
yep
mm hmm
yep yeah
yeah i think yeah mm hmm i think putting gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option because we weren't offered yeah it would be nice but uh okay i'll try to find out but uh
i th
yeah
okay we'll try but all these yeah are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also
the offices of the school and you know people just don't wanna change in general um let's see maybe we can
find some temporary well at least a proposal for gisella so since the one person rooms are quite
well sort of um desired by a lot of people she should probably no y yeah okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
uh the the middle one here okay
this one okay
mm hmm well
yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah well
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm yeah because in this case yeah gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor that
i or
ah okay uh
yeah or an intern mm hmm
yeah okay okay so this sets a bit the stage for uh for gisella then
uh yeah we'll try to to find out um actually yeah maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors
at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant so b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition
maybe not to be followed
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
um okay so i think well this sets a bit uh the stage uh
could we try so could you try please to uh do you want an extra uh piece of paper maybe try
to well think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you
mm hmm
yeah no the point was to try to well just talk to them to david or
mm hmm

yeah so w w w will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place because uh huh
well but that's
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
okay th then okay then for the next time um try to come up either with your own preferences
that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people
around you that would be i mean even
well just discuss i yeah for instance i mean no no i was thinking just ask people around you what they think about
this and i think yeah it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these if you can do slides it's even
better but uh don't be that formal and uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent
proposal and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available
um oh great
mm hmm perfect
yeah
and i'll try to
fine
what do you mean by cafeteria exactly
what
yeah w we can bring your coffee in the reading room but
so so since maybe you're a part time here and part ti part time at e p f l  there are at least two
um coffee machines in the building one at the third floor one at the first floor and we can bring our coffee
no uh automatic uh coffee machines so uh yeah but in
uh huh
mm hmm
yeah vending machines mm hmm okay yeah maybe this is not a very bad timing
could we try to meet uh next tuesday um next tuesday
maybe at t maybe a bit later maybe at eleven o'clock
come on try try to be nice
gi give me a reasonable date
yeah for me it's a good timing
uh huh okay
okay
mm hmm
very well so about two o'clock would that be okay after lunch it's not a very demanding meeting so um perfect um then let me close this
and uh good luck for your arrangement games
mm hmm
uh they have another group and then uh uh uh andre and agnes will discuss about it with you are the rep representative of this group actually

hmm
yeah uh okay uh me personally i would like to to to share the other peopl n uh the room with assistants as
when you have problems of normal life like uh the printer doesn't work uh i don't want to ask this to my
supervisor so it's better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room
mm hmm
what uh i don't think it's a good idea to share uh t to ha to share the same desk uh i still would like to have my drawers and these things
it's
it's funny that uh we move to another building because we run out of uh space and we will have the same problem
ah okay

but uh usually whe when new assistants come they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l uh it's related with the project so he can
mm
no okay
mm hmm


is it allowed to smoke inside an office if it's a one person no not any more
mm hmm
wow there there's no place in inside the building wow e t p f l  is a c it's a non smoking campus but there are some places tha
yeah yeah yeah






w what abou what about the the the cafeteria i mean we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or reading room yeah it's altogether
so in the living room
bu i ju just before finishing uh i mean we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all
a place n what mm uh we can take a coffee also
no

but they close at five or ah okay
okay okay
yeah yeah this
ah that's the main problem

okay

yes i ha i have no constraints so it's fine
and don't forget the
i have a copy yeah
two
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
do we really need that
okay
yeah
yeah
and if we don't get this space then what happens
these yeah
okay
yeah why didn't we have a meeting together

well certainly we have to ask uh pierrette and uh and maggie since they're not here because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do and so that's another consideration too
oh great
ye mm before um talking more about individual preferences is there any possibility
what they have done in the uh faculty of law for example that they actually split rooms and so we would take
uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it and you would see that you would have the same size office but that would give the privacy
um insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building every professor has
their own office and it's it's really it goes a bit far that uh we have to have this uh all
this sharing uh so one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms uh
that doesn't really solve it uh
i mean there's there's really a difference to having to have your own yeah and sometimes you have uh you need to have private uh discussions with somebody or whatever so
well i i think it's uh really a matter of personal preference as you know um i prefer to have uh my own office
um i also have uh a lot of phone calls and y you know have to see people and with the other work
that i'm doing with the rectorate uh that is really confidential information that i'm treating so i
that i have to be really careful about too but it's a personal preference uh insofar as what we've had up until now
both maggie and pierrette have been happy to share with others so i mean i think that we should still check with them
well not sharing with each other they each share with an assistant yeah
paid on that
mm hmm
yeah and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too so
for example uh marianne de uh she's also working with me on the virtual campus project so she that one wasn't mentioned but i'm not saying that i necessarily want to be with her in the office but uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project uh
yeah
yep
well yeah we'll skip that for now no i d um the lounge okay but i think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time so they actually have a place to work
no you want to have visitors yeah
yeah
yes but we have more space here than what we currently have so it's at least some

mm hmm
no
no because they can share their ideas across the project yeah i would say

no and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices for example uh bruno and agnes are sharing an office and they're working on totally different projects and and they're they're just fine with that

well there there were but they sort of disappeared as of october when the no smoking rule came in because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there's no smoking uh i guess that's not very important option though
well except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony so
no
no n it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building you can smoke outside so you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke not even in the cafeteria no
full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students
yeah yep
there is the there's that terrace
no

the other way
no we we do have one constraint that's difficult which is uh gisella because when she's there she's very noisy
she's on the phone a lot it's just it's by yeah it's by nat uh by the nature of her work that uh a lot of it is communication yeah
yep
i think that's a excellent idea why don't we ask about that
i mean there is certainly enough space uh down the hall wi if all of those uh uh offices that are where half of them are also half time and they're very under used so um
and pierrette too
yeah with with younger people yeah
no
so we we invite invite and then we say okay you can sit with gisella

um
except for in every other faculty
yes it is so every other faculty as far as i have seen their offices and the people that i know and that's in um in law
uh socio economics uh okay it's a they all have their own office i mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time
we're gonna have to


okay i'll ask um uh maggie and pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences
yeah
no
yeah since they're not at the meeting i think it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them
he means reading room
no coffee machines
no there's the cafeteria is downstairs but they close at five
yeah but there's the two machines and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money and and you can get yeah yeah
wait
wait wait tuesday um
ch
um we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the m d m  meeting in the morning so it would have to be in the afternoon
yeah exactly
yeah
at nine thirty but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon nah
yep okay yeah okay

okay
oh yeah
andre just yeah just a a clarification question are they number of people per room indicated strict or
can we play around with i mean if there are two people is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half
or uh how how was it calculated
'kay
mm hmm
i have everything
okay so
are you sure of that
mm hmm
yeah but counting the rea the the reading room
mm hmm
and susan don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room so you should be able to valorize this if possible
but i still agree with you that the b the we are not so we are not so large as far as space is concerned uh because
fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions so uh to the best
uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room then you have
uh sixteen places mm
yeah that that also means that the growth will be zero
visiting visiti visiting researchers students coming for exchange students et cetera
we j we stay where we are
no the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space
andre sorry for interrupting but uh one again clarification question what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have
for these discussions because uh at least we are half per cent uh fifty per cent of from e p f l  and
uh sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken so uh
um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things so what what will be the impact of what we will
come out come up with
so another way of a
another way of asking the question is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it
but wha why why don't they have any representative here i mean
yeah why do we do it separately
okay
no but you know that that's a standard thing it's suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the
corner and we don't know about that we'll put them put her or him somewhere else then we will do
plenty of work for nothing because we'll not have this constraint we'll not be aware of this constraint
oh okay
okay
yeah
yeah
i agree with that that's
whe whe where part time is important is that it's n an overlo load on a room so um for sure if you have a part time
person it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room as far as i am concerned
i probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here
um the uh the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that i will have a lot of phone calls
so i'll be talking o o o over the phone all the time so that's not necessary well it depends
on i i have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody i d already did it before so and it was
perfectly fine
it just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room which is very d much dependent on people some people are not disturb at all by this some people just can't work
i'm not but uh and uh what might happen but it uh it will not be so
heavy here uh at issco is visitors so that i will have more at e p f l  uh
typically students coming in um or asking for things as i'm not teaching here i'm
teaching at e p f l  this should shouldn't be a such a big load
so for me it it will be essentially i will not be i will not be able to be silent in the room because i will be communicating also through vocal means so
hmm
yeah
hmm
do you go for boxes for instance in the in the bigger rooms where yeah you know like uh cubicles yeah
hmm
you mean you really want to have walls
four walls
yeah
yeah sure sure

mm hmm
yeah
hmm
yeah yeah
i fully agree with that that's uh it's much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room than uh
oh sharing with their students oh sorry because but that that's uh it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons
as you said yeah you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project you over the phone typically you don't
necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part
of the discussion so
no
no because pro project doesn't last in time they will change
that's what the only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people mm
yeah they will promote that
but still th some things well yeah
yeah
if if it if i if projects are what you have in mind i think that uh meeting room is the the tool for that if you need to have people in a projects talking together they just have a meeting room if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice
yes
that's why i was quite receptive to uh susan's remark at the beginning is i wouldn't
formulate it in a such a an extreme way as do we really need the lounge but uh i would p probably formulate
it in the way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room
because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work
but on the other hand we also have to relax so that's
yes
yes
yeah
yeah
'cause that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion
and this will happen i mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors and you shouldn't
which for for fifteen people it's not enough i mean uh
yeah it's we have we have four professors here and and and two researchers
mm
it's bad it's bad

because this is really related with security uh regulation as well i mean you can't just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris yeah uh it's not necessary heavy in terms of work it's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation
at least at e p f l 
i think so if you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way
yep
yeah right that's the point
no
coffee machines are that made for that
no that's that's proximity doesn't play a big role there we can discuss with people that the the space is very small i mean altogether it's
and uh you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer how do i get furniture i'm i don't have a a pencil where is the the box with the pencils and so on this is not project related
yeah
yeah that's true
no
it's non smoking campus
not even in the cafeteria downstairs
okay
wow
on the roof maybe
the balcony okay
but andre uh just a
still some places where smokers can survive but andre just a comment abou about your your previous uh request i i
don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom that's a typical uh
output of ex uh research in expert systems these are the rules that you never get but uh you can get them through a proposal
so you propose a set up where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct
ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains but they prefer to have view on the old town so they
would be in the toilets they would um p prefer to be in another room
yeah
yeah
but that's a sec s that's the admin that's the admin uh so it's part of the work yeah
and that that's a problem you're right because because we don't have a one person we d we don't have enough one person rooms
for uh accommodating the uh the admin place and uh if you put two person persons or three persons
for the admin space who who who else would you put in there
because we don't have any assistant manager or we don't have we have only one half part half time uh admin and no other non researcher positions if i'm not mistaken and this is really a piece of a problem maybe you could put some visitors but um
i know it's not very uh realistic in a in a in an admin room but uh
yeah because
you can't put a researcher there that's just either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager
yeah

yep
no that's not sure that's not sure uh the there are to me there are two options possible is either you we can
take one of the one person rooms for the admin because some of typically the professors
have good reasons for sharing sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their
uh one of their p h d  students in that case it's it's realistic then we could very very simply
uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin and that would solve the problem the other thing is to take
a two person room for the admin that could be the one uh close to the uh close to the here in the centre so
uh the yeah
but tha no no no the other one the the one op yeah here this one but then uh that the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open
so i would be i would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that let's say the at least the two full full time professors that are here on the list we have one here but uh maggie is is not present if they really
yeah and pierrette if if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room which might or might not be the case i mean it's it's certainly not uh something that we should impose but we can ask
yeah but that's not realistic either i mean you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office
uh you'll not do that i mean uh maybe you can do that with an exchange student that's
but you can't take a senior visitor and uh him in the in the secretary
uh you're here
as susan said p
yeah is that so
oh
yeah
okay
no no that's it
as we said it's it's really a matter of personal preference it cannot be something else it cannot be imposed for sure it's uh
job
again uh uh um andre i think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves
i can tell you according to what i know now where i would like or would
be ready to be but i really don't see how i could decide for uh maggie or pierrette
or whoever else on the list that they should be there
yeah b why why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for for the the set up of meetings you you everyone received
that and uh should provide yeah i would like to be here and then you will have this
multi constraint problem and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution
yeah i would i would ask for their place i mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know
uh it's a reading room
reading room it's not a cafeteria
but that that's an open question whether it's a it's a it's a it at the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for
relaxing uh reading the newspapers et cetera et cetera uh there has been a very long discussion about
that i stinct uh this discussion is still vivid that some of the people i bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed
room where you can have a reading room for sure but also meeting room if necessary or as uh susan said
a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment
for for for for work because you don't have any other place to do it but that's that's really an open discussion and that
d i think no decision no final decision has been taken about that
yes
yes
the one that i don't want to have in the next room

okay
okay
that would be great that would be great
c that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about
yes
yes
we don't have cafeteria
no there is no coffee in the reading room
that was the wrong we we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines so
five
and you can bring your coffee in the reading room
t to try the coffee
wait wai wai wai wait next tuesday
uh well well well well not so easy eh
next tuesday we have a meeting yeah that might be where is the meeting it's unimail
okay so yeah yeah then it could be that
that yeah that that would be great because that would allow us not to move or not to travel twice
yeah after lunch right yep okay
thank you
hey look these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts
um okay so um let's start
um thanks for coming again to this meeting i hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some
progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our
new rooms uh i hope you had fun in uh well designing something or uh
asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this so yeah that's what i was talking about it's for
women's shirts um so um well i think you remember all the
constraints and the new settings i think you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we
move so we have these one person two person and three person rooms um
and so that makes i think eighteen places and we had about fifteen
people and some uh spare uh spare mm well working places to to put um may
i first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time
oh great yeah so that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution
but regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations
between the rooms so that means basically well we have to do with this setting and uh
it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls so i think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh
four years maybe and they don't want us to sh i mean they don't want to
provide an extra working space for gisella with the other i t  admins which we could understand
because it's sort of full over there but uh at least that's what they said
so it seems we uh yeah the well we cannot change the habits of the whole
school just for us though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe but uh we'll see so regarding the
possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms um
well it's not very easy we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing
it it looks like it's not impossible at least on the one that is a bit uh longer on on the right
so uh the one uh here it should be possible to put four persons if we could avoid it it would much simplify
things but uh well we'll see
no no no no
yeah i think yeah it it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture but uh since we are experts at this
task uh okay so maybe we could count on on four places but the final decision is not really ours so
uh we'll see actually this
exactly or one of the intern positions the people who might come or something like that
um okay so these were the um the answers so actually i
i did my uh my proposal as a slide would you like me to start or would you like me to end
it's uh
oh great
beautiful okay then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale
for for this so it's the same uh schema that you know in red you have
the uh uh oh excuse me that's quite uh annoying excuse me um hello
oh yeah um can i can i call you a bit later in about half an hour i'm just in the middle of a meeting and i'm talking
oh okay thank you bye bye um sorry for this fortunately
we were just uh the four of us um okay so let me get back
to into the proposal after the brief interruption um so the names are in red
now um well one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more
or less group people uh with within projects because i i think that sometimes they ju they just
discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office
and um which is quite happy actually i i also thought that some professors might
enjoy or at least uh don't don't say anything about being with their assistants so i was happy to hear
susan uh saying that maggie and bruno could well together and pierrette and uh marianne
in in the same office
um so what i can say is uh that i also understood that susan
would be rather in favour of uh well having her own office so uh it's it's it's working like this
i put the lounge in the middle it's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows
so i think that's not a problem because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside
uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office i guess
i don't know yeah maybe i thought in an angle but that's obviously not very
yeah okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place here okay
yeah we'll have to check tha yeah but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for
it maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer so okay but uh i wouldn't
well insist on this i think okay so the printer well we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution
so uh i m two is more or less in the upper left side um i said more or less
um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have swisstra and
so the two projects from the list and then on the on the right side
maybe not a ver a very good solution for gisella if you can suggest something uh better because she's with
two people who uh well two p h d  students and it's true that she has yeah a lot of phone
calls to make but um it's some way to to solve some constraints i think this
is a very open thing uh if you want we can use this document or we could just say first
listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one

um yeah maybe not a very strong one then they maybe you are you have better suggestions um
it was i think sort of one of the uh places they re that remain and i i think yeah there is no
strong constraint and uh well she's a smoker but the policy is that we don't smoke so it's even better
if she's uh with a second person
uh huh okay
uh huh
mm hmm
yeah mm yeah that was the case and uh she was a bit uh reluctant but
mm hmm
yeah we could store files there and things like that mm hmm
okay so if you want i can already do this change here
sorry you're
um
mm hmm
yeah th yeah th when the printer is yeah it's it's the main one we have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room but it's basically yeah the peop the the printer where everybody prints um so i change this
so maybe i would suggest let me le k can i hear also let us hear from you
and then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one then we go back to to this slide
and if not um we'll just well start from scratch um
mm hmm okay
yeah
yeah i'll try i'll bring my walkman and uh

yeah uh david you had also uh what's
ah
uh huh oh let me put the plan sorry i will display uh yeah this is the empty one i don't want to influence you so so you would put uh
yeah
yeah
mm hmm you can you can even stand and just show us there
okay so we would prefer the names okay i i don't want to influence you too much but uh mm i'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things
yeah maybe in different just
uh huh oh
mm hmm or actually pierrette is a woman too yeah it's the feminine of pierre
uh huh
bad
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah and for me it's also uh i would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office just to be a bit
calmer and martin so i'm very happy with you since i proposed it but i could also be
happy with most of the other people so even in a three person room it's it's fine okay so let's keep
in mind maybe this uh constraint of balancing the the genders uh we'll see if we can
uh do something for it
uh i've asked some of them and i've also used a little bit uh what i've well i mean the
the present arrangement just not to to shock people too much and it's also people that i know um
get on well quite quite well together and also work on the same project like for instance marianne uh
uh the finnish marianne and uh nikos who interact quite a lot on uh on um yeah maria
and yalina seem uh to go on one quite quite well
uh nancy had no strong preference specially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in
in her office um yeah so i think well at least as far as i i
asked there was no major objection
um
yeah that's true that's true i um so we could put nancy with david and uh put agnes yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah that's a small advantage and uh i it's a bit more uh more comfortable actually um
mm hmm
yeah maybe
mm hmm
yeah very good mm hmm
mm hmm yeah probably
mm hmm
yeah
so agnes has worked
mm hmm they they have worked together on so this makes some sense um at yeah i mean
yeah as far as i know i think it's probably quite a good uh uh good match
first one should be maria but it's still uh one and a half okay let's switch uh
mm hmm yeah
mm hmm
i'll just uh
yeah mm yeah i i don't think
yeah so s s okay so since we are supposed to do a final proposal sorry uh let me move the printer um next to the photocopier
okay and we'll find some way to um well attach it to a wall or something like this
yeah i think so yeah um okay so that's the uh mm hmm uh i don't think we can put visitors in the lounge it's uh
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah
it's
mm hmm
how
how would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices like in well
in in one of the one person offices w i i know they are actually quite uh quite demanded so
um i th i think susan you are very happy with this solution so okay in gisell

yeah it's probably too small okay yeah doesn't work mm
mm hmm
okay let's be innovative um
mm hmm but the problem is it it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we we need the lounge so i i think it's simply not
no actually uh i i'm sorry it's uh yeah mm hmm
oh okay so so how do we split the room
this one uh huh
mm hmm so
yeah but what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge
well not the newspapers because no scientific articles
journals
uh huh yeah
so you would like to put it yeah within yeah and then who who yeah
yeah yeah okay but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side uh here
and uh here we'll put two places for visitors three but that means the office will be
at least for the moment empty that looks very bad
okay so that could take the the free place over there uh i mean
yeah i think okay so we need what two three positions and one new person arriving x  or something like that
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
and and where is the lounge
no okay no way i'll i'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge so uh
no no no no let's do the lounge corner okay at least i mean otherwise i cannot really defend it because it it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every every decision we made
yeah i think so yeah
okay
well let's have the visitors first okay so what we need is a new and two so
i think we can put what maria or yalina i don't want to separate them really but uh
oh mysel i don't like that office actually um so i was thinking to put here
yeah now so it's either
y we could put the visitor with you martin but it's probably okay let's try le let's try this uh let's try maria here oh you don't mind
perfect
no no we'll put a visitor place in there
if you don't mind
uh i think it's paola
yeah
um
yeah could be
if
yeah mm hmm
no i i would prefer you i think
okay let me keep you
okay we'll put paola and a visitor here
so paola is the new person
and a visitor uh vis is that vis one and then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here vis two
oops
sorry it's not very nice but
does this display better
i think it's not bad
yeah don't put her alone uh huh
yeah
yeah no but we said that we won't discuss or maybe if we organise some kind of you know coffee at
the end of the day or a drink then the two people will stop working i don't know maybe they won't be happy okay then martin
let let me put you in that office and i'll put paola with me no
so martin goes where
yeah
okay
yeah okay
yeah that's true okay so let's put maria in the separate office
and we have paola
oh sorry what were you thinking
so who is with maria here okay
yeah and no visitor
yeah but that means that this room the middle one would be quite empty all the i mean two visitors and the fifty per cent pers person i don't think it's very uh reasonable
yeah but let's split them a little bit so that when there are no visitors at least people are
yeah i think so
so this goes here goes visitor two paola is there here goes visitor one and is this better
except that we cannot read it but
apart from this
mm hmm
yeah okay let me call this visitor one which implies that uh it will be the first
one occupied by a visitor when they come and this visitor two which means it's like a well you
know second uh second chance
or we could what would this change
mm hmm
oh yeah very good
yeah so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall
uh huh al although there are three windows but um okay so where would we move david to maria da with maria do you have any preferences david um
well he already is mixed so yeah
yeah
yeah i wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room because when there is no one it makes a big hole and when there are two people so it makes too many variations but
yeah
mm hmm
you prefer that too susan okay
okay
oops sorry uh what did we say here this one
yeah my uh
okay
well i think that was really decided and it's it's no we no because actually if we do a proposal without a lounge and you know the other group will
yeah exactly and that means that all the constraints that we said and uh all the other things just we we well just basically disappear
uh huh which means we've worked for nothing okay uh what's what's wrong with this
okay
uh i don't oh you have to go susan okay
yeah well we are almost done susan but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items yeah please okay no problem
yeah we we'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no um
yeah mm hmm
yeah i think that's okay yeah we checked uh
i don't think so no
mm hmm
yeah that's a bit yeah that was the point in letting david there and but okay maybe we'll just leave it as an option david or visitor one or two it's uh
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
okay so we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable yeah either yeah we can switch maria or paola or david yeah
mm hmm
yeah no exactly yeah tha tha yeah that's why i always try to put the to separate the visitors just to balance a little bit but okay we'll uh we'll be open on on that point
yeah it will become
mm hmm or it depends also on well if yalina stays longer or not which is not yet very clear but um
okay w we'll see anyway we'll we'll be open
mm i don't really know i think her master thesis is probably due um no i would say yeah maybe june next year at the latest yeah actually i don't know unfortunately
well we we won't have any extra meeting well the four of us so yeah this one has to to be the
the final one um so um we'll we'll have actually i i'll present
this to well with the other i'll compare it with the other one and uh try to make a decision actually i think it's even
uh a bit later or in two days or something like this
again okay we yeah mm hmm
yeah w we can leave it like this and then
uh yeah there will be names on the doors
so she'll be a visitor
mm hmm

okay yeah we'll we'll keep it like this um okay i
well i'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that
the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh well s things could be changed over there
but on some other sides
yeah the visitor space yeah i'll uh
mm hmm
yeah uh that's true and
well
i think this i i'm not very sure but i think this will be done after the meeting when okay
yeah mm hmm
uh huh a as far as know i think agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay yeah i'll circulate this perfect
yeah exactly
okay so maybe we'll learn some more constraints um okay
um yeah actually as i as i told uh martin um well this is the last time
we meet so uh this is well more or less our proposal and uh we'll have a meeting i think it's uh it's in
two days or something like that uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh well make a final
decision actually probably a pre final one since we'll have to check again with everyone but uh
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm well so actually i think i i'm not very sure but the most
important thing is well finding out when we will move and this happens in probably i think next month
or depends also on how well the uh the furnishing and uh
well goes on
no
um
oh no no no no the roo the the building is very no actually i've seen it uh the building is very modern and
uh you can have actually we'll get them activated yeah a and i think you get at
least th yeah three per room so uh or probably more than that
okay
okay
yeah sometimes he needs two two computers yeah no this this
hmm
oh no unfortunately that's decided by the uh the school so the the chairs are blue the the desk is uh is brow well light brown and uh
uh normally it's done automatically except that we'll have to think
yeah uh well these are dictated by the names uh it's probably more difficult for the lounge
what we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the well the old it's not
old because we just bought it but uh all the furniture from the previous lounge we'll we'll bring it here
uh
well it's the faculty that will take care of uh
yeah yeah i think yeah i i mean it's a completely different issue from uh you know arranging
people it's just uh how the moving will take place and there are things to to take care of but uh it's uh quite unrelated
with these things yeah we'll get uh we'll get all the information uh thinking about internet connections
i think it's quite okay for the the for the the printer to be there yeah i think it's i it's feasible
we'll we'll check so the the violet box here is uh uh our mailboxes
also
um not at the sixth floor yeah yeah no not not in the building for the moment
i mean not at this
mm hmm
mm hmm okay well i think it's a bit off topic already so um let's say that i it's
a proposal we'll try it i'm well i'll try to to express the the constraints and uh
your opinions and uh well i think finally everyone can veto something if there
is a huge problem but i think with this we we don't run into huge problems
yeah obviously so let me save this
and thank you for spending all this time
hope you're all happy


that would be fine if one of the person is fifty per cent so me for example
please







because the professors uh you have personal printer or there is only one printer
because if not the person the printer can go in a room of three people
that's typical of case where there's the lab and there's the printer is there



yeah okay for me uh as uh i don't know l uh the people a lot
uh you suggested that uh there's a la a lack of men s so i would re certainly put uh
not two men in the same office i would try to share them with the women so uh for example
in your slide i could uh switch either you or martin with uh uh
the other room this one
so
yes please
yeah yeah i was wanting to change this wa
mm hmm
yeah but i need your uh your slide because i was talking about your slide
yes so here you can see that the the the men is i mean they are always sh sharing the room with a g with a woman i mean there's bruno me uh pierrette and nikos is a guy also
oh sorry for this
mm hmm so i mean this is perfectly fine i will just send martin and andrei for maria or or yalina or nancy maybe
so
yeah here there are two men so i mea yeah i it's nice i don't think i mean there's a lack of men here in in in this in this lab so i would change one switch one


but we agree that it's not important to to share the room with someone that has the same project
quite happy to have the the full room some fifty per cent of the time


is there anyone that is going to finish p h d  or or leave or




no but a lounge in a one person room is really too small

no no i don't think we can choose



no
let's put m maria or yalina in the in the in this place
no lounge






well the the lounge can not be in here t with two people i mean you cannot go there and discuss and and two people working there in the room

sure not me
that's true


uh it's completely fine
then uh the two visitors will be in one room but doesn't that's fine because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time uh we'll see
one





yeah yeah you need because sometimes you need a laptop and


so you agree with a lounge

no no it's the opposite
and i also checked with uh maggie and pierrette
great
come now it's not full over there
no uh no and and i and i went over and i looked at that room too there's plenty of space for four people
yeah
ah
exactly yeah
mm well just t just to uh uh complete uh i talked both with maggie and pierrette and both of them are happy to share offices they have no problem whatsoever
uh they're they're easy but uh could be uh as pierrette has right now that she cou she is happy to continue
to share with uh marianne uh and and maggie for example to share with uh it could be with bruno
because they work on the swisstra together and they like to gossip together so

people who don't turn off their phone in a meeting it's fantastic

yeah
yes
no yeah
yeah why not put the printer out in the hallway
it is there enough space there for a photocopy and printer
the photocopy is a bit big
well i've a question what's the justification for giving nancy her own office
mm doesn't help yeah
well gisella will not be very happy about that uh we tried that and gisella really didn't like to have a printer and people in and out all the time and uh
uh remember andrei that was uh yeah yeah
lot's of phone calls yeah
earplugs uh whatever
so yeah you have to show us which one you were talking about david we didn't
ah the centre room
uh he wants to mix sexes

andrei did you ask these people if this was okay with them
yes
yeah but agnes is also working with david so
yeah but there's
yeah but that doesn't mat that's not important
there w one question i was wondering about though 'cause three is always uh well the more people in a office uh the less ideal that wouldn't it maybe be better to put david in since he's only half time so that way then
there's not three people all the time
yeah
uh no uh maria is maria is the closest but she's still not uh uh yeah

no because don't forget we already have somebody coming in uh january
at least one person
yeah or we make four space in the three people rooom
yeah
yes yes
that's an excellent idea
it's too small for a uh yeah
we put it the the furniture that we got for our reading room we put it into the other half of the three person room
would that fit
a little divider of some kind
well not just newspapers
but also to read articles
mm hmm
it's not a visitor it's a a new p p full time person arriving in january
no that's where we're gonna put the lounge
well for
no no no no we we have to
yeah yeah yeah
no there's no space the lounge is in the free space
after all that we went through to get the budget for it we really have to uh

no wait a minute yeah
no we are not gonna keep marianne in a three uh person place uh just having marianne in the lounge yeah




but wait a minute then andrei has a two person office all for himself
yeah
wha what's what's her name again andrei
paola
okay martin goes back to andrei
um paola well paola being new i i think it would be better to put her with somebody else
no no put why not maria or yalina
martin stays maria's
well we have
uh yeah
no the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied uh oterwise we might uh lose room or two

this is always the game
no but but look martin it's quite a long room it has two doors

yeah the occupancy is better that way
because there is regular there is regular occupancy yeah
we won't be very credible
i'll be right back
i i just need to see somebody
sorry yeah
no because there is another person right now a student that i just uh um hired and she's just working right now for uh
for november and december yeah
a she uh she's a she's a real visitor she's a real visitor that i just made a contract for her for two months yeah
what's the timeline on this now so you have a meeting when
mm hmm oh yeah
how many connections are there per room
no get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines
yeah
yeah
no because lots of people have you know they have a sun and they have a a pc so

well we have to say how many places that we want to have
yeah they'll just give us a date when
the well there is downstairs in the building and pretty soon the whole building will be covered yeah
yeah but right now in uh downstairs it's fine some people can pick it up on sixth floor but pretty soon the whole building will be covered
yeah okay
yeah
the the question is is it is it against the regulation security regulation of the school that's that's the important point
okay

mm hmm
okay okay
yes that looks good
people sh yeah that's
let me check that i i di i didn't s
yeah but putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge
it's not a question where it is it's a question of you are printing all the time so
uh
yeah that's that's a possible
yeah why not
uh i would have i would have a provocative suggestion to put gisella to switch nancy and gisella
put gisella the fax and the printing machine the printer in the one person room as a as a
okay so the printer that's that's not the s not the hard constraint but uh
'cause i really do think it's important to have
an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room where you have files where yeah you can close it you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera etcetera
so for instance i be fully against the fact that my personal files are in f in a in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that
printer can be in the in the in the corridor that's uh that's uh that's perfectly alright
i'm perfectly alright to share the room with you has a view on the old town that's um
you have to be aware of what i was saying last time was that you have to suffer some suffer from fro from phone calls
so if you have a walkman that's that's good

yeah because there are plenty of things that are that are okay so uh
yeah but for pierrette an and maggie it's uh it's
it's a wish or it's uh it's because they
i didn't get your solution what was it again
so
ah okay
but that's not so much a question of uh men or women it's more the question of as i said that's uh
um here you have only p  you have p h d  students that are a group there you have s senior researchers that are a group which is to me more
unless it corresponds to some specific demand like it is in the case in maggie maggie's case and pierrette's case i think that's a very efficient way of doing things because
yeah mm i'm perfectly happy with with andrei so
sure but um
but isn't there just a a a question of proximity you put david with agnes
um but isn't agnes working
um in a in a more substantial way in uh with people like uh either maria or yalina
'cause
yeah yeah i i know
no that's true that's true the other constraints are are satisfied somehow so
no but what i mean it was was the three the two three person rooms i think that they can mix them the way they want i mean if they
prefer to be uh maria tha uh yalina and nikos and nancy and marianne on the other side well no that's
not completely equivalent because nancy all are p h d  students or masters students but nancy correct
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so i would switch david and nancy typically
which doesn't mean that david should be in this room he could be in the other one for me uh the two three people rooms are really
they have to be uh re shuffled according to people personal preferences but i definitely would put uh nancy
with agnes in the two person room
yeah
but again it's also a question of personal preference i mean you you can't be in a room with person you don't want to be with
i see if you do it this way you mean that in the two three people room there will be one that is not so overloaded because
of david because david will be part time and the other one not so overloaded because there is uh one free position
uh knowing that this one free position uh will not stay free very long
yes so
and this is still a worry for me because we are still we don't still still don't have enough space for the visitors
unless we put them in the lounge
therefore i w
yeah yeah
we need to have at least three visitors' position because positions because
outside
yeah
so that we keep it you mean
it depends it depends on how we think about the lounge if it's thought as being a reading room no if it's thought as
the que that that's really a very important question to me do we do we put priority on the fact of being able to read
newspapers in our in our offices or in our uh work place we can read newspapers
elsewhere
and i really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that
come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers newspapers you can read them home know we can go to the cafeteria
or you can sit somewhere else you can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer so i i don't understand why we
why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors
that's just not not according to my priorities

s so let's let's put the lounge in susan's office and susan's in susan in the lounge with three visitors mm
i would advocate to just remove the lounge we it's a luxury for us we don't have space for a lounge it's
let's be you you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying
i p if i have to choose between uh reading my newspaper and disc and having a a decently welcomed uh v
uh research visitor i prefer to read my newspaper that's just not that's just not realistic i mean we are researchers
but then
then you have the three people room that positions split it in two parts as as susan was was uh
proposing last time was a ha was a wall and you have a lounge there can read your newspapers and we have a full
two room two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors and at least we have
some uh free margin for the next two years or the next year
the the three people over there
yeah and put uh uh mm
they are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge they are supposed to read their newspapers
and to drink their coffee
uh scientific articles no that's not that wasn't the goal the the goal of the lounge was was a place where you can relax
you can do it in your office
it's it's it's you have a good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break you heart your your your your back your office
yes
yes
three
no we have our visitor that is arriving uh what did you say susan
uh okay
no no that could take one one positions in the in the lo in the
ah okay that that's an idea if if if if you forget about the lounge what you could do is to move either mari maria or yalina in the in the mm what is currently the lounge that means that we have one person there with one free position
we have one free position in the in the room that maria or yalina is coming from and one free position over there so we have three position distributed over the rooms where we can accommodate
no lounge
louge
you take the furniture of the lounge and you put it in the corridor
you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet because there is a reading room where people have to relax
it could be nikos for instance could put you can switch
but it's a lounge
yeah but then
yeah you could you could put me there i mean andrei
because i will be there half time and the visitors probably will not so much complain about phone calls
well there is this full time person arriving in i i think it's really important to to plan with that
would it be possible to have paola in your office
'cause that's that's something that we we should be deciding either you want to keep me in your office which is alright and then we have to forsee a place for paola somewhere i i think that's that's not realistic to have a planning
why didn
yeah
that's visitor one
mm
somebody else
not supposed to discuss you are supposed to relax
because you don't want to separate ma maria and yalina why
'cause yalina i it's not even sure she stays it's a master student so uh
yeah
and we have yeah and we have two visitors and a masters student and a p and a part time person
i was thinking the other way around
to keep paola with maria in the two people room and to have this one with two yalina and david in the three people room
paola
no that's a two people room so
yep
no yalina is there david is there
but you need to have to put visitors somewhere i mean uh
ah
oh
okay
well
it's a little bit crowded in
'cause you have well not yet of course because paola is not has not arrived but uh starting from january you will have two full time person plus one part time person plus one visitor that's
'kay
okay
but why couldn't we basically
move you david in this two people room with maria
maria plus one half pa uh half time person
and you have paola yalina one visitor position and i still keep hope that uh marianne nikos
that the lounge will on the on on the on the long term disappear because anyhow i
don't believe there can be a lounge where in a place where there are already two people working so the lounge will just die after
some point and it uh it
still i mean
ah okay ah it has two doors yeah that's true
ah yeah but then then yeah okay okay okay that's true 'kay then then there will be a wall okay
yeah that's good
uh she she wa she wants mixing peo uh men and women so or she he yeah right
yeah that's to me it's more realistic
yeah but then then you can you can move for instance if you move david to uh with maria
then
i think it's it's better first it's better i think it's uh because it's more it's stabler
'cause visitors stay and go
yeah that's good
to me that's the best we can do
if you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge
okay okay okay
i go i got the message
yes sir
so who has strong
strong opposition to that
but do you have any no

but it's just a decision no you just have
okay
i think we we we accommodated most of the constraints 'cause uh we are sure that maggie and bruno uh maggie is happy with having bruno in her office and pierrette is happy to have uh marianne in her office that's that that checked okay
and yes and no reason to think that there should be uh uh uh uh an impossible situation
same thing for marianne and marianne f  and nikos
uh paola we don't know yet because she didn't arrived yet and uh well yalina aha that means for a for a short time yalina will be just alone in the three person room
that's a bit a problem
ah but then then we what we could just for the sake of having a defendable solution uh as long as paola is not has not arrived is to switch for the proposal paola and david
but we we really plan that as soon as paola is here or even earlier
david will go to the to the two people room
it's just it will be switched
'cause this this this this is dangerous to propose i mean you have a three per three person room with one masters student in it okay so i wouldn't i wouldn't propose that
okay
but as soon as paola is here
uh it starts to be better and we will have visitors for sure
yeah right right that's true yeah
oh yeah that's a point true ah do we have a do do we know do we know when when is she supposed to finish the her uh master thesis in june
june next year
okay wha when when do we when do you when whe uh when are we supposed to sub sumbit the proposal
'kay that's now
okay
mm
okay
well so as soon as we have susan we can uh we can um so i would i would switch again
da but that as i say it's just for the sake of the of the proposition so i even i'm even ready to uh to internally say that david will actually be in this room
what does it what does it change names on the doors
aha so if we 'cause susan the the the the problem the let's say the techn not the technical
the psy psychological problem we have is pra i'm extremenly happy with that solution
it would be a workab work working solution starting from january when paola will be here but currently if we present it as it
is we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student
aha so sh you have a student that we that's a rea real visitor to some extent
ah so this one and this two one are just ah okay okay so then we would have two people there okay
yeah then that works
yeah but you you really have also to say that that that a a unit has to has to have some some horizon i mean uh it's it's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us
uh the second point i would suggest is that before you go to defend it you should uh mm circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con involved people
to double check so that
i would do it before 'cause you if you if you spend time defending a thing then um i don't know agnes comes to you or pierrette comes to you saying it no i don't want to be with marianne uh what do you do
so so it doesn't
cost anything it's just people will look at it say oh great i have a view on the mountain and i'm uh with a person i like so i'm happy
because
yeah it's it's it's not it's not completely it's an important issue because uh i need to know when
i will have the office decided the phone number decided because these are information
that i have to provide to administration i'm reachable when i'm at uh well they can phone me on
the mobile but uh i would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative
form that i can give back
yes yes
okay
and then uh of course you have these all these practical issues how about internet connections well uh network connections i mean
yeah because that's also something double check you know if you are in a room with three people and one network connection
well no no um
okay
but are they activated
okay
okay
ah okay good that looks good
and if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli slide where you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m any any word to say and uh so that i would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a
so that's the standard things
but do we have to order something or is it done automatically so it will be in the office when we move in
mm hmm
mm
and how about the boxes because at you have to say when you will be moving the boxes so that you have uh people for moving them or here you're supposed to move them yourself or
so we'll receive some information about that
okay
that's true but uh right right right okay okay
yeah that's an important point the the printer needs to be connected
by the way uh uh is there any uh wireless connection uh antennas for getting 'cause i i've i've heard that there is one downstairs in the
that
but that's important i mean typically for the laptops it's
ah okay good
yeah yeah
mm
sure
at least the four of us will not veto
at least

okay

i just forgot their name so uh you're i sorry i just forgot them all so i have to write it down
so
do you know them or
yeah
yeah
yeah no but your b your surname
w o  da okay
okay
and what's your name
w i e s  z z  or s  uh uh zee okay what's your name
yeah but your surname
your surname
okay thanks
yeah me too so that's not no no no i just fi first my
so let's have a look we have forty minutes so it's it's more than enough

okay perfect so we have oh no what's that
so so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure that we are
that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like uh first i have the notes of the last meeting so i showed uh show them to you
oh sorry about that i just escape this one
how do i escape this
how do i i escape this s uh presentation
ah okay and show sorry okay so let's have a look s at this one
okay so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control
no that's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be
a t v  remote control only so have you changed that part um so
yeah it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly it's it's still the same
um
all these points uh we have to
look at you all know them but uh there's another point the um uh the main
uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people so they're old and not younger people so we have to look at that as well 'specially old people maybe bi bigger buttons or something i dunno
uh so
so yeah that's it so just you can do your presentation for uh
oh it doesn't matter just start with the
i i didn't read i read it so it's not for me i didn't get it uh anyway it's only for you
yeah
the last point is quite an interesting
so if we
yeah
yeah we should have the ten percent on the on the top then you're you're

so we have uh a new uh age of forty plus
people so yeah so we just can skip the l c d  r on the remote control because
yeah it's too okay
because it's too expensive yeah probably
so it has to look uh uh uh unique but
yeah
but old people are not looking for that
not really
okay yeah
yeah okay
thanks
so paul you can do the next one if you want
it's on the on the uh net net uh thing isn't it
so what do you think of only the numbers and the on off button or
okay
yeah
okay
maybe i maybe it's too complicated but not sure it's a good idea but
uh
uh mayb for me it's if i use my telephone i never use those buttons to to to call sh never
so and
if i don't do it maybe old people
it's not it's still not it's not anymore n uh

just on the front as well no that's the only th the only thing you need
just very simple
uh yeah i know what it is but i think it's all too difficult for old people
and how do you want to uh do it like if you have a channel above ten normally you can press one zero or
a ten plus or
okay
but do we still need a two level remote control because if we only have that l only f no
yeah
maybe it's still still a good idea i'm not sure you'll also have to use a mute button to to
maybe not i don't know where where you have to put it
okay yeah yeah that's right
yeah does it have to be uh it has to be uh with different colours or
it's like a imac or something just to make it
but it looks cheap as well because it's a small thing it's only twenty five euros it looks very cheap if you make it
oh you just i dunno what happened
yeah we have to look at mobile phones that's right just
yeah
yeah
okay we hurry up a bit because otherwise we won't make it is it fin are you finished okay
so we we also have to have a led li led light on it
yeah it's i think it's usable
yeah or just a green one because it's if you use it it's green or the red it's r green
yeah that's right but if you
red's l shows up like something's wrong and green is like it's okay you press the button
yeah i know okay we make it red
you have to the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons uh that's cool
no we have a recharger in it so
if we can still make that then
but it's cool if it was green green or red or whatever it is cool
i just say can you s just say it again because i was just looking there's just a short
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
okay yeah
yeah

okay so that's the led l e d 
yeah okay
so we can make the normal one also a normal light not a led light but as a normal one
to flash up your
yeah
maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push so you see green if you push that button
yeah but if you u if you do that you know that you're uh sending a signal and it's you also know which button you p
yeah that's right but it
but does it make any difference for the energy you use you got still one led
that looks different yeah
the same as a telephone or a mobile phone or what do you mean if you push
it lights up everything lights up that's a good idea
it it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much
it's f yeah maybe that's a good idea for old people as well
it's only few leds only four or something four led
yeah that's a good idea okay
everything agre everyone agrees with that or okay
yeah and then you
okay yeah
but you have to make a sound device in it then
but yeah
okay are you almost finished or just
okay okay no worry
yeah i just want to talk some about some more so maybe you have to yeah okay
so this oh sorry wh what's that
so uh oh sorry we have some new uh project requirements we have to have a look what they are they're still in um
uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet so a teletext option maybe we have to skip that one i'm not sure i don't think so but
yeah and it's it's on your comp it's on your television it's only one button so i don't think it is we definitely should use it um
yeah that's uh what i told you the remote control should only be used for a television so that's maybe easier
and um the the forty plus people i already told you
oh no sorry oh this is a problem oh sorry about that the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty so it should be flashy or just more interesting i'm sorry about that i just i just didn't read it well
so does it make some decision about that
that still stays
yeah
yeah
yeah maybe we have to integrate that as well
if it's possible but
i don't think it's very expensive actually why should it you only have a microphone in it
nah maybe
maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that it we have short time to to put it on the market so that
we have to do a lot of testing before we can do that
we make uh make uh we can make th th the new remote control very flashy
yeah
yeah i think so
so we have to make some decisions so you can see on the uh so we have to know what we're going
to put on do we do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything do if you press
something it lights up for a few seconds so you can see what other but buttons there are okay
okay we just take that one and what else we have
yeah but it's oh th i thought would that that would be the same if you push something it it all lights up
or you can switch it on or something
yeah that's right you have to yeah that's right that's what i said it's the same as the telephone yeah
and do we use a a uh what's it called like a imac if you can look through it or just a normal remote control
yeah
different colours okay so y you just make it th through you look through it okay
and so the buttons we have this is yeah this is normal we put in the the simple buttons on the top and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there
yeah maybe you have you have to uh when you use teletec teletext you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one or to go to the previous one
o but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control because you ne almost never use it
yeah that's right
yeah for me too it is so we just keep it one level then okay
yeah
okay
okay
so that's it for toda for we're going to have a lunch lunch break um
so yeah you know what you have to do this is uh this is it
you get your meal and everything so
yeah
so we're finished for t for this time we're going to have some lunch
yeah

paul wiezer paul wiezer
a  e  z  zee zee
e  r 
uh
yeah same here
uh let's see which one was mine
good
uh left so
okay
yeah okay
which one first
okay
functional requirements yeah
no i didn don't thing we got it yes
uh
maybe just a button on the home station so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station
yeah
yeah but good usability so you can use it
unique
yeah i reckon
uh i think mm
uh
yeah
but uh we also have to stand out 'cause there are already like you said so many controls out that
support lot of stuff but we have to make sure that we're better usability and stand out
by just looks of it so make it just a different colour or different shape so
okay yeah well
uh
there it is
okay technical functions design
okay well so we have s mm uh broad audience isn't that isn't true anymore but um we have elderly people so we need to keep it simple uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard
so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls not too full like uh jens already said only ten percent is being used
yeah i have it on the next page but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff
um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use and 'cause you have
more room then and for elderly people big buttons uh an icon on it or text
on it so it's very clear what that buttons does so it doesn't take much time to figure out uh
how to use it
um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or
just ask some random people elderly people what they use what they want on a remote control
to find out but there is already in a
one done of functions i could think of uh volume channels the the basic according to
just one two three etcetera uh text service options
um basic on off and i found an uh could i think of favourites
i always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number
but if you could make a new option that you just have to press one button and you get on your
no y
well it's it was just a thought so i'm i u i would find it handy i think when you just press one button and you get on six six six
well uh what i was reading on the page uh a remote control just sends commands basics commands
to uh the television so switch to channel six
so uh button six says says six and if you make favourites it can say six six six in a row
just numbers that can be in the in the
well if you said a favourite
well i
never oh
oh are you
okay now m maybe not
no maybe elderly people uh right they don't like new features so maybe not
um well play pause i dunno if that's usable when
not anymore for t v  right on off i dunno miss did i miss any other buttons basic buttons
i couldn't think of any other 'specially not for t v 
is
just the channel um uh what i mean is uh
six seven eight or five
um i dunno i don't have uh i did
yeah i don't think you use that y only when you want to go to
yeah just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time
yeah i think um f especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons so you have that uh
yeah the ten plus button just uh one one pressing or quickly after each other
to just keep it simple and standard uh features
uh yeah mayb but i think that's in the t v  as well that's how the uh the t v  t v  handles it but you can have a button that says um
two two st two stripes so you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons
so if you have a universal t v  controller you needed one button that has two uh stripes
so we have a a period of i dunno five seconds to press those buttons and that and not for elderly people
to look one two uh press and aim and
so i i don't think so uh i just thought of another one most things in modern t v s are also on the menu so you also need a menu button and then uh navigation uh
but we can integrate that with volume and previous and next so you have
four arrows
yeah okay but um
yeah a mute button yes don't think so
yeah well that's that's i think that's the layers that produce now i have to figure out what's uh what to put on what we're gonna use and later we can d uh do the design
okay uh now my personal preferences uh using the standards basic
um i think that we should stand out uh unique being unique with the design
so we have to i dunno uh make a different shape than usual so when you are in the shop and you see our t v  controller hanging that it stands out not just in in the row when you see
all the same uh remote controls
um
i dunno different colours um
yeah well why not or yeah
well maybe you can look at uh mobile phones oh
who
they they're uh designed very well and well basically are the same just a bit smaller you think you can't make a t v  controller too small 'cause then you will always lo always lose it
but uh well i think that's a good example
okay sorry well uh yeah i i'm finished i think we discussed everything
uh j is ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting
so
yeah maybe uh
maybe depends on uh
yes
but maybe well we don't have to make it red maybe integrate it in the design as well
uh oh maybe it's it is would an e no just uh

oh
yeah but it doesn't have to be red it's just to indicate something's on
yeah it's it's not very important so yeah
so mm
so we have to uh make buttons for that as well to make it uh
okay
well i i use a universal uh remote control and list of all the t v s you have etcetera and you have to put in a number so it works on your t v 

okay so we use that
yep
no y yeah
no i don't think so but yeah i it it will look different and i think we need to find something else yeah
'cause otherwise we will just make another standard and our uh motto also is
yeah w around the buttons or in the buttons even
yeah then then won't then you won't see it

yeah we're thinking about it uh on a mobile phone in the dark uh
everything lights up why ain't that on a remote control
yeah if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it it's
yeah i if you're in the dark you can't see the remote
no i dunno but if we use a battery station which i think we will use
yep
and also it's
okay it shouldn't take much
uh i th
i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options but we lose about ninety percent of those options so i think you can uh
yeah i think we will save money with that
yeah
okay that's it changes things

um
well yeah then we have to make some nice features i think uh the thing in the dark is a good way to make it more like a mobile phone more modern
that's important i think and
and i d i don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control especially when you only have t v  functions on it
so
yeah i tho i think that's not usable so but uh yeah what other features can we put in
it's very fashion
mm
mm
yeah i think it's
what but uh i dunno how that works then uh does your uh does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever
uh one to have in channel one
yeah i dunno so is it very usable that's what i'm looking at
is
mm yeah well

it's
i d yeah i don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition
yeah well yeah that's the right command and then you have to say uh t v  channel one or something not just one but
well i dunno but i don't think it just ain't useful enough
yeah i think so
yep
also the one in the dark so uh
it lights up when it's dark i didn't
okay
yeah but um
yes that's what i mean
or maybe when you yeah
it lights up all
okay yeah d yeah alright yeah
maybe just as an option w like we discussed like ipod different colours uh maybe use even different fonts
like uh phones
yeah uh as an option maybe
it's the standard
yeah uh
yeah we but we don't we don't really have any complicated buttons
yeah okay but
yeah well w i think the buttons are very easy with just uh standard buttons we just have so little
no i don't need don't need uh teletext options are only four buttons or something
i use teletext as well
yeah yeah one level and i think uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons i think the design is most important you can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much
'cause simple buttons if you put one above it it's clear
how long is lunch break
okay

bye




uh martijn
what
uh abbing a  b  b  i  n  g 
i was a little short on time but
what
uh
just yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think the main thing is the usability that's where we can uh make it a special product yeah
okay
yeah but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel so you might as well remember the number
or not
yeah okay but um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button
yeah
yeah okay but uh uh for a user to to remember if i press that button it goes to that channel
yeah but isn't it hard to remember like favourite one and
mm as as hard as
no neither do i
yeah i dunno
uh uh the p uh next and previous previous i know but next channel i don't thi
li like a web browser so oh okay but uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before
like a web browser back button
yeah okay
yeah
yeah w wouldn't it be a problem to uh because you h have to be fast enough maybe the elderly people
oh okay yeah
yeah but that's th mm
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i i think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use like um uh
m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things and uh the
menu button because you n almost never use menu button so
okay
mm hmm
okay
well the working design
the method i used is uh search the web just the web page provided
um
basically i'm i'm not very technical uh uh educated but uh i could figure
it out um basically what happens is you press a button uh then a circuit
gets closed by pressing the button uh like a switch
and by closing that certain circuit the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed so like you press a one that circuit is closed and uh then the chip produces a pattern
like a morse code to uh and and sends that to the uh l e d 
that's the uh light emitting diode i think um
and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light that's un uh
invisible
to the human eye and uh transmit that uh to the t v 
however it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's
uh blinking red if you look in it and that's uh another diode i believe
because infrared is not visible so that's er uh do two different things but
yeah i i think so i i'm not sure if it's the same thing
yeah
yeah when you press it so
two
yeah i dunno ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red so
so i know
i i think uh the batteries will be uh a little yeah okay uh maybe

yeah that it's working that it's not not the batteries are low
yeah i know just to indicate it's working
and uh the receptor in the t v  senses the pattern so we have to understand what patterns are used to
you know to make it universal so that it can be used with all the t v s we have to
really understand what patterns are used so we can uh o on the otherwise it won't work
no i i uh the chip um uh is producing the pattern so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to y you know to yeah that are working
yeah or i dunno how it's uh exactly how it works it wasn't explained there
yeah
okay

ah okay
okay
okay yeah so it uh we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one because you have to yeah
uh okay well uh y you have this chip that's uh when the circuit is closed it produces the pattern but uh ma basically for uh brands of t v  these patterns are different
so like when you press a one on one t v  it go go to one and on the other t v  it won't work basically
so uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right
and uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh
cha yeah changing this pattern all the time and um
what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern this chip uh is trying to switch off the television
and when it's uh switched off you can push a button as uh it's working now so and
then he saves that setting and then um it's working
okay
well uh the components yeah that's a bit technical and i hadn't i w i was a little short on time
um but i think i understand it um the energy source is uh the battery basically um that's connecting to all the components
because it has to be fed with energy okay uh the subcomponent is uh w
i i think it is uh the button pressed so basically when you press a button a switch get closed
um that's connecting to a chip so the chip knows what button you pressed
and the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb i didn didn't put the description by this one th this is a normal bulb so the normal flashing light
yeah yeah and this is a led too but this one is producing infrared light that's invisible and this one is producing normal light
yeah
yeah presu yeah yeah yeah because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work it can basically if the battery is low it won't work so you have to indicate that it's
huh that's a good idea
hmm
yeah but mm like when you push it n n yeah you have your finger over the button so you can see yeah or or m maybe on top of the a green light is flashing or
yeah there yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah we'll have enough power to
yeah
hmm
yeah b maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make
especially for that kind of money because it's i it has to be yeah production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half
yeah okay
yeah okay
yeah the the personal preference i didn't fill it out because i was short on time but um
basically what we could do too is uh have a bluetooth uh integration
yeah okay
no and i i think a lot of people use uh teletext still use
hmm
oh mm
yeah that kinda changes the whole situation
yeah
mm ah i i don't y you'll use it often because you can see on the television wh what channel you

no
yeah i think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and
popular and uh then the usability is not that required because
the like in the mobile phones usability is not that good i think
i didn't read
i didn't read any b yeah yeah okay
i i know
mm
yeah i don't know
yeah but it has to work and and and does it have to work only in english or in dutch too or
and and uh w yeah
yeah it's probably my job to figure that out but
and and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or
yeah i dunno
yeah i think so
and and
yeah and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition you can just throw the uh
the remote away
mm hmm mm yeah okay
but
hmm yeah
t v  one
yeah
yeah that's good
mm maybe it's a good idea
hmm
hmm
yeah but younger people i think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext so uh
hmm okay
yeah

yeah

okay
fine
the names
for for for my sur um jens
uh damman
d  a  w 
uh uh m  m  i mean m  double m 
oh sorry

okay
okay
mm
uh
okay well my name is jens damman but we're in a group and i i will start it wait um i've
used a marketing report on uh the site uh i think you've uh read it too uh and uh f and furthermore i uh surfed the o the other site
you didn't read it
oh okay i i was the only one who get it okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users
and uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof
so i um i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings
so we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control uh seventy five percent of the users
find uh most remote controls ugly
yeah i think uh uh that's a lot so we have to make a beautiful remote control uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy
i think this fits uh at the uh what what uh michael said about uh older people
older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good because
younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at
uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot well okay that's uh normal i think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons but that's one of our requirements
yes fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons um martijn alr already said it and uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one but
i don't think it's uh
reachable
yeah the ten percent on the top yeah that that's a good one um uh page two remote controls
are often lost somewhere in the room that's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station
for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something
uh i thought mo maybe we could make a clap system so when you clap your hands it will beep or something uh you must find it uh quickly
okay yeah yeah we can uh combine that uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control uh i think we must t uh take a look at this
it's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent but it's uh
a tough one because if we make a ha whole new product our own style we we c uh this
is so difficult uh a difficulty i think
uh next remote controls are bad for r s i  yeah but only if they zap a lot and they watch over five hours t v  or something i don't we we haven't uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point
okay last page uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets
like uh speech recognition we didn't uh think about that already and
uh an l c d  on the remote control we already thought about that
um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features and but they're more critical
and older people uh want to spend uh more money but uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features because they're in their old uh thinking way and they want to keep the old uh things the old things
but y but you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients
i i think we can speak uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly because it's not reachable for twenty five euros um then
i have my personal uh preference okay that's not very good because i thought about television d v d  player stereo and v c r  i had a question about but it's already out of the question this
um my point is well i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television i think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five euros but it's the exercise
yeah only only for television uh on the market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control for everything and we only make it for television so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special
okay i told about the home station uh it must be simple because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it
and i i found a motto and we put the fashion in electronics and that's uh
the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style we we
have to make a a new product we have to be um yeah
one of a kind i think
the company is about our uh th th their own fashion their own style
yeah to k to keep it simple when you sorry i thought about it yes
okay this was uh my presentation
i don't yeah you can ask some questions or something
mm hmm
um
forward
no uh
it gets some seconds
yeah it's it's no it's not a
it's what paul says it's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the t v  um do one two it's the t v  who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two
it's only for television now
no

maybe we can give it out in different colours you can choose blue or yellow or
that's fa that's fancy that's uh fashion

okay
mm hmm
yeah that's active
i i think it's in the case that it's active it's not uh
i it's it's just uh the the
mm
yeah
empty

yeah
an automatically search function for each television or something
uh i kno
oh i have a modern one and the modern one you you uh you type uh search and the
led began to blink blink blink and uh uh uh after uh a short time the television
turns off and then you know oh it it's the right one and you can stop it and then it's okay
so you don't have to search for your television or your code it uh search uh the pattern for itself
yes
changing the signal
yeah that's the right uh option


uh if you if you use the buttons uh both of them works but one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button
yeah yeah and
mm i think it's unnecessary power uh you use then
okay but then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be leds
everywhere in the r
is leds uh beneath the the buttons
yeah okay
it must be around it then
yeah then yeah not not not not here but here
maybe uh
okay
yeah i uh
yeah
maybe what paul said uh under the on the on the home station uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control that it beeps
yeah there must be sound in it
i dunno
mm uh twenty five euros i think we can make it bec
twelve and a half okay but but we only have to make it for television and um we must have something special so
uh
we have to give our customers some extras
no
uh

okay

changes
uh
l c d  doesn't work for uh twelve and a half euros i think
oh
oh i'm watching uh the channel one okay no it's not
but uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition
about you said one and the television turns on one is that reachable maybe that's very that's fancy
that's cool twelve and you've got twelve
only the numbers only numbers uh furthermore nothing but only the numbers one to twenty or something that should be cool
if it's possible i dunno i didn't read it
uh if i if i i didn't have information about that
ah that's a problem but
uh only in english only in english i think
no that
yeah then th we have to think about that but do do we do it it's more if we if we do it
yeah
okay
yeah and uh and uh
in uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing uh because we we have a lot of languages
yeah
a uh someone says that uh give me one coke and the t v  turns uh to one yeah it's not uh
okay but th that becomes your f uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition
mm hmm
okay no speech recognition
yeah yeah yeah it it mustn't work all the time it uh uh it have to work only when you use it so if you no if you use one button it must turn uh on for twenty seconds and then it must turn off
oh yeah
a see through mm that's cool
but you have you had a lot of different buttons
no i use te teletext every day i think
mm

trendwatching okay that's fine
yo




mm uh


okay uh agnes you can help me for the slide when okay
okay welcome back
i hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time
how t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting
okay and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you
and it's in the i think uh in the sharing folder
and uh i will invite uh the christine and the ed and uh agnes to discuss about on the various subjects
so can you go to the next slide
yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening
then uh i'm going to talk about uh the project management what i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing the project management and secretary both
okay to take the minutes of the meeting
and there are three presentations
one is uh new project requirements
and the second one about uh decision on remote control functions
and uh finally we are closing
uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes so you have to be very quick
and i have come up with the management come with the new proposal okay and i have to discuss a few points on this
uh both says new insights in the aim of your project
uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology
so we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design
and the second one is about uh the remote control
should be used only for the t v 
that's what our uh management says
and the third point it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image okay with this new project or new product
okay
so i will invite uh
agnes can you go to the third slide
okay
so i'll invite uh christine to discuss about uh the functional design






yeah let me uh interrupt you uh
if you can add other facility other feature like uh unbreakable
okay because uh especially today you know you have the family and the kids okay and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and
yes
okay so if you can add the feature okay for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design
okay with unbreakable okay i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product
if i'm not wrong
maybe you can uh add it in that
okay uh thank you christine and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications or any discussion on the functional design
yes

yeah so
yeah the the i'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing
uh let me go quickly maybe if i can go back
i know the project plan and the budget
so i can close this not sure
was in uh
s
this
so let me see where is this file
this is christine

that's yours okay
saving
okay uh i will i will send you a mail okay the project may be the the project aim okay
at the end of the day the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million euro
okay and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side
okay that maybe eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market
okay
then uh you can come back with your feedback
and i i have one maybe the suggestion or opinion this remote control okay it can be for like universal to use for any t v 
okay and it will be slim okay and uh
not fat
okay
yep
but let's try it okay with the different uh the designs okay the functional designs
okay
so any other questions
okay thank you christine for uh time being so then uh
ed so can you tell about
mm hmm

yep
yep
mm hmm



yep
so what do you think about uh the design do you think you can make it or uh
what do you think about uh the design uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition
mm hmm
yep
well what i can uh suggest to you christine okay uh if you need some uh the technical feedback or some training okay about uh this facility especially for the speech recognition
i can recommend you some companies like uh intel or i b m  okay because they're already in this uh speech recognition part okay
and uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them some kind of a technical tie up
okay and uh if you want i can coordinate okay to get some information okay and uh you can uh let me know okay so what kind of uh the details you require
okay to add this feature
in this project
i don't think it's uh the difficult
and uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop
apart from uh what today
yep
yes
yes
yes
yep
yeah but but end of the day you're the sales guy so i will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection okay
it's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit okay
and uh so i don't mind to convince okay the management to spend some more money on the project okay if you can make out of
the money from this project yes okay i don't mind to convince the the management okay
the management says okay so they they don't want certain facilities which it's already worked okay they want something uh new okay
i think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree i don't think they'll say no for that okay
and uh i hope i can convince the management on that okay
so if you have any uh new ideas okay for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special okay coordination okay between any uh technical companies which you can uh hide their technology backup
okay for your uh functional design or technical design okay then i am ready to do that
and uh what's your comments about uh
yeah so you are finish ed uh so i can uh
okay i'll uh hand over to agnes
just gonna close this t
uh where are you here
participant three
okay so i'll yep
okay
is it okay alri
click mm
so for anybody need uh any help for time being on
this uh subjects okay so please come back to me and uh christine maybe i can uh try to
help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim
okay and to add some features like we are talking about the speech recognition and all
yeah
so not really this one we are talk ab
yep
okay that will be great and uh i'll send you the the minutes of meet
yeah
okay what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break okay then uh we can discuss furthermore okay with our areas and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting
so thanks for coming and uh i'll send you minutes of meeting and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information
okay
so let's go for lunch then
thank you
'kay do you wanna open the
i'm number two
that's it
i'll do the notes yeah thanks
so um well i i figured uh we should um
identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh and from research
i did uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button
you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point you know really have
it needs to be able y y have to be able to find it
because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them
so uh i also since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those and as i said in the first meeting
um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use
in uh in the construction especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that
it gives the appearance and it is reliable and so forth
i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth
so i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic which i kinda like the idea 'cause it made
me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t v  on
and off that might be interesting
and um so it was highly directional flash light
that uh you could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels c so
i think um those are still requirements we have today uh fifty years later
and uh it was really a pioneering innovation but it was uh sensitive to the sun so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems
so uh
i in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today
which i think the one in the middle
is r um really uh something to keep in mind it'd be easy to find
and um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the t v  didn't turn on and off you could use it for something else
and since i'm not really um industrial designer i didn't really know what to do with this slide
but um
i just took some different uh schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board i don't know why um we were asked to do this
so
uh personal preferences um
i think we could uh i i'm really thinking outside the box here and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference
so something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it
i think um it could either be you could go either one extreme be very colourful or you could make it clear
and um kind of blend in with things so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with
the th the decoration of the of the user's home
um i think uh it needs to be waterproof because uh sometimes they fall into cups and you know it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that
um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its
job or not because half the time i keep pushing on the remote control and i don't know if it's actually understood
my message so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue
and uh course i never wanna replace the battery
so that's those are my f preferences and that's my presentation
yes
run over it with a car
good idea good idea i'll i'll uh um
yes very good
hmm
titanium titanium would be be heavy too wouldn't it
no i haven't really um i wanted feedback i think we need to rate rank these but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts
i like titanium it's light
uh yeah but uh who who said who said we were you know nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is so um
it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though
not fat
not fat huh

might be hard to find though
oh okay
speech recognition 

d uh i'm sorry

well uh training is always an issue with uh commands
so um might uh we can perhaps um do
it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process
uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost
not sure how
but um anyway um i i think also that uh this might impact the battery life
and um so maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly
so that uh y you know sen send power to it
so uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh you know gets uh from the light um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things
off
very good point
okay we'll find that out

oh it's um seems very understandable clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction and um uh
the only thing that i saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it
so uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all here at the table so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary
i also think that um uh th f the the feel of it
is uh when you hold it is something that um
uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design
and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an industrial designer's more thinking about th th the look and the feel and uh you're
first yep
mm hmm
okay so i don't have any questions
sounds good
do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
doesn't really tell us
well it says individual actions it says user interf so i'm supposed to do the components concept
supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends
um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach
i think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process that's my suggestion
you can object if you want to
i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting 'cause w our meeting time has run out somebody else has go to use this room and you know we can't hang out here and talk about this so
thank you very much
yep sure
no this is the third slide
sure
um
you're participant s
two
do you want the mouse or do you want me to
mm hmm





do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials
'cause for example in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be harder whereas having something like i dunno steel or titanium isn't really economically viable
yeah
yeah
sure yeah no i just wondering whether that you had any sort of
yeah
the marketing comes out

that's christine's
and that's mine i think
in modified
s 'scuse me for one sec
hmm
it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t v  there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words it's not just you know noises like something hitting
it's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out
the t v  speech and the the user's speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying
the same thing all of a sudden you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies
because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your t v 
so i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems then yeah it'd be a really good marketing gimmick but i think we seriously need to consider how that would impact
the situation
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh yeah yeah
no i think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements
yeah



um well i mean maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments
mm participant three
nope here
good
thanks yeah and that's fine
okay so basically the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products so in our case existing remote controls
and then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which isn't always as obvious we seem to
have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad but when you look technically at how it
works sometimes that's not the case
then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work
um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t v  on and off you need to change channels both
by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing you need to be able to control the volume and then control
any menus on the t v  to regulate contrast or whatever
so the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general
the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do
um often you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often
and that the buttons are too small
so here we've got two examples where here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons the buttons in a lot of cases are tiny
um they're hard to see and okay they're labelled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much
whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities
that are needed and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first
look at it so i would be inclined to go sort of towards this in terms of design rather than this
and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons
so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit or to a minimum sorry make frequently used buttons
bigger and more strategically placed so like the on button being really obvious one the channel changing and the volume
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple
which i think ties into what christine and ed have both said fairly reasonably
um so that's pretty much it an
i don't know if you guys have any questions or
yep
yes that's true yeah
yeah
mm hmm yeah
yeah
oh that's definitely a very important factor especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases i think
oh
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table but
do we actually want to incorporate all of them or have we missed anything
sure
mm hmm
i thought
no i i'm just thinking in terms of time like if
yes now i'm objecting no i mean i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features
that we're just gonna end up throwing away i mean it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone
to consider different features um
and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want but
i guess
sure
yeah
yeah sure
okay
fantastic

titanium
expensive


i don't know i think verbally we can we can pretty much sell
hmm
uh from her side i don't think uh there's too many more questions if you can come to the
okay from the marketing yeah from the marketing side just to to give an idea what the management is looking for i was looking for a a remote control to have a s
i have a sales price of twenty five euro with a production price of uh twelve and a half euro
for what uh i think from what we're trying to find we're tr we're looking for i don't think that price is exactly in the market
okay
i'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh
in a in the recent surveys uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy
twenty five euros uh that's that's a preson reasonable price that's a market price right now
now if we're gonna take a risk and push this up a bit make it more expensive but give them added things that they don't have now then it w it could possibly sell obviously the risk is there
too expensive they're not gonna buy
but i think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is
that uh from the fifteen to thirty five year old group which always spends more money on trendy new
things speech recognition is requested
and we're talking between seventy five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote
obviously we can't make a remote into a computer but maybe simple commands
i dunno louder softer on off
that might be a possibility even though it costs more to be the first on the market to produce this
thirty five percent say they're too difficult to use
so we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly
uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time
so maybe one word speech recognition commands say remote and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it through you know ten tons of newspapers magazines whatever you have at home
but in the cost that uh the management is looking for that's not gonna be possible
but if it's trendy if it's fancy it's got some colour to it if it's very easy easy to use if it's got simple
remote speech remote uh control like i said louder softer change channel
on off remote it goes beep beep i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset
'cause i can't turn the t v  on
so we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea with the ideas of the industrial uh design
but price obviously we have to talk about
speech recognition
mm
because tha w with speech recognition uh th i'm not that good at that idea but th
if it's a one word recognition 'cause i know with telephones and cars and things i've seen in the states a friend of mine says call mom and it calls up mom
'kay the radio can be on and everything
because i think s with speech recognition if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear
i don't think it would come through a sentence in a television
if somebody's speaking on the se the television they're not gonna stop and say remote okay
so i think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word
like the t like the telephone
no because i this is this is years ago in the united states where we're driving down and he said call home and the telephone called immediately so well that's kinda cute
from from your side uh you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise what do they want
uh a risk take a risk on the market something that's gonna cost more but could very easily s
make a boom in the market
because it has to be something totally different has to be total totally new something that nobody has right now
and it's gonna cost

mm hmm
sure sure
obviously
if the bottom line is positive
mm
mm
yes mm

hmm
individual actions
she's objecting
oh th we s we still have
yeah right
agreed
hi guys uh good morning everybody here
and uh i want to introduce myself uh my name is uh shrida daseri and uh i'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now
so i want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here
and what you're uh drawing
uh how you spell your name uh
e d  okay
and
so only accounting
okay
and
mm hmm
industrial designer
so who is uh marketing nobody in the market
it's you okay
so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all and uh we have a long time just twenty five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation
first of all i want to ask uh mister ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh
mm hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or
oh for the moment not yet okay but uh what's what's your uh do you have some project plan something with you or
mm hmm
okay so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan okay a discussion with uh
by next meeting okay that will be great
uh
okay so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project
uh the goal of the project i think maybe i'll uh hand out to the ed okay so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting
yes so can you explain uh what exactly the product is
oh i think uh if i'm not wrong we're making the remote control
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
and uh what abo uh christine what about your uh the industrial design plan
are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
so uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team for the design
yes
okay
that's
yeah but uh before we talk about uh the finance okay uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also
mm hmm
okay but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design
yeah but uh i need something in the writing so like uh what's your functional design what's your technical design and uh how many people you need for this project and what's the time frame you're looking okay and what is the budget maybe uh initial budget you're looking
okay and uh how is going to the market okay so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan
okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition okay so i need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you
okay and it's po
b as soon as possible
yes i think uh that would be good because i need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do and uh what cost
is okay and what's the time frame and what's the project plan because uh without any uh documentations i cannot
go to the management and say so we are going to do this and we need this much money
okay so then it's it's difficult for me to say okay that's the reason i need uh some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can have the further discussion again
yes of course if you need some help uh so let me know
so who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view okay to add in any documentation or some technical point of view so just let me know so i can uh coordinate all the teams
yes thank you
okay
and uh ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy

hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
yes so what i uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the christine okay because you know what she is going to do it okay and you know how to sell it
okay because uh she is doing the design but you are the core because you are in the marketing okay so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money the finance okay tomorrow
so what i prefer okay so you need to interact with the christine more and uh within her team okay who is
using the functional design or technical design okay and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan
okay how we are going to do the your sales plan okay th
th
that that's
yes that's you have to decide okay so the best thing is you uh both of uh the christine and you
discuss with yourself okay and come up with the cost and how we are going to compete in the market
okay in the the technically or in the sales wise okay the commercial wise okay
then uh we have to design okay how long it will take the whole project okay how much is going to cost us and how much we are going to benefit for the company
okay of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually
okay so i think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan okay
including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team okay then it will help me to discuss
with the management for further okay and put it in the the proper project plan
okay and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors okay depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan okay so you let me know
okay i can coordinate or maybe uh you are my coordinator am i right
between uh all the coor
yeah
th christine yeah
which is
yes
yeah so basically you need to interact with christine more okay for the user acceptability okay and the testing okay then you will
yes
yes
yeah
yeah
yeah
yep
but what i request okay keep ed in the loop okay in between your uh meeting and christine meeting because uh he should know what's happening
yes
okay and please please copy all the mails okay all the discussions to me okay so i need to submit to the management
so any questions for uh time being
yes
okay
to come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with ed okay and how it's going to be work and uh first
of all with your user acceptance okay how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market
okay so then we can discuss about uh further things
so we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting
it's okay
thanks for coming
yes i will yes
i'll copy uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies okay share each other okay so you know everybody what's happening okay
and if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me or just send me email or uh just come and uh knock my door okay so i'm available here
it's good
okay thanks for coming and uh i wish you a nice time then
okay see you later bye
uh sure my name is agnes and i'm an user usability user interface designer
um i was wondering
mm hmm
mm
mm
well no not exactly i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that
so i think i'll have to interact with christine and discuss with her so that she's not designing something that
my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in
but i don't think necessarily that i'm in a
coordinating position for it
yeah
mm hmm which will also feed into the marketing because depending on what users want depends on how you sell it
what tag lines you attach to it how you try to make it more attractive to users so i think
all three groups will need to interact quite a bit
um and then i guess build the plan based on all of that because i think you need to take all the factors into account
yeah of course
yeah we can c c  him on any discussions or documents that are passed around
sure
no problem
so the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design or okay
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah that would be useful
sure
okay
thanks
thank you
oops
that's as far as it goes
do you also do marketing
and i'm christine and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer
but i'm not really one
what is the goal of the project

um no i i have not begun working on the design and um
i uh i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control i thought we were designing a new
monitor um the website i went to look at had some
announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um
monitor and um i understood that that was the project goal
so um i'm glad i didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh i clearly didn't understand the project goal
um i just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team
composed of these people and um that's about uh that's and
i i read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps
uh for the industrial design
um well i would th think that depends on how much money you give us
um because uh you know you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models
well you know um i kind of think that in general you have to do uh um
y you have to have something that's very fashionable that's uh very attractive that um people see
and recognize uh its goal and uh they immediately wanna have it uh
have one of their own so it would really would need to um something like the ipod
would be good seems to have caught on fairly well so um d uh you know i don't care what
it does just so it looks cool
well uh i've got a lot of other projects i'm doing right now um and so i'll have to wait and see how those
uh how those go if they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month if um if i
run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months
mm hmm
mm hmm
and when would you like that
uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough
uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan

okay i'll get back to you on that

would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides
thank you
my name is ed and i do accounting
e d 
mm
no
accounting yes
marketing is uh is me
well i think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product
we'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this
uh for the moment not yet
good question
no this is like i said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together
certainly by the next meeting

i'm in the sales i'm supposed to explain them what to do we have to define exactly what our product is from uh
from what i had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee is that right
remote controls 'cause i had two different things i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then
so we're have to design something that is very user friendly
something uh visual that has something that will will draw people
to buy the product because i think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls and some remote controls
are are worth uh throwing out the window
uh th most of them ar i don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it

well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to
do uh what they're building their designs their ideas uh also have to pinpoint which
market we're gonna go into it should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the
competition uh th i agree it has to be something it has to be something new it has
to be something that that draws people saying eh i like this
whether it works or not they have to first say i like this i like the design and then it's gotta be simple to use
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
do we already have a cost limit on this th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for how much it's gonna sell for that's up that's up to us to decide eh
very good
very good
no
hello oop
okay
okay we're just going to the later
so we're going to talk about the conceptual model

so that's me uh okay so uh okay
okay so i just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes minute what's it called i dunno whatever
okay so we just talked about uh oh you want me to show that there or
okay we just talked about it looks has to look nice usability is very important people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones um
it has to be very basic not too many buttons
light switches on if you use a button uh text t v  still has to be a possibility
and it has to be easy to learn
that were the things i uh make minutes of and the functions are volume channel to choose channels an on off a mute uh button and a text t v  button that are the functions that right
okay so i just want to give you uh mike again the first uh
presentation of your
yeah
but we already have the flashing flashing light on the
okay
yeah
hmm
but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground so it has to be flexible
that's a good that's a good idea if it's de like that that's good a good idea is it a bit like like the the the the remote control
r  soft
okay

yeah
it's very uh difficult to to to do it because it's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control
okay
but that's definitely more expensive than
yeah but a telephone okay yeah but a telephone also have a l c d  and and it's about t two hundred euros so uh
yeah just modern modern but still uh basic
yeah maybe the teletext tel
no
yeah
yeah

but it sounds very difficult to use because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it so you can't use your thumb for it
yeah down there
but it's not not the best best
yeah for volume for volume or a channel yeah why not
and the channels as well
oh yeah
yeah that's better
yeah just th th th other buttons like text t v  put that on the button bottom
mm hmm yeah
except from the on off button
yeah yeah that's cool
okay
we have to decide this this lecture or this this this uh fifty minutes yeah how it is gonna look
okay so hmm okay
yeah we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control so the colours also so we have ha to ma make it in black black yellow
maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black
we make i maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front

yeah it's cool yep and still trans
still still transparent
okay
yeah we make it som maybe we have to make it from soft material uh i'm not sure
yeah just give five with them just in a box five different
yeah cool
yeah it it could be like a nokia like plastic that's better prob yeah
yeah
yeah that's cool
but maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material just only the basic uh
basic remote control from normal plastic and
the rounds of it from softer s
i dunno
y
cool
yeah y i if you the numbers could be can be yeah that's right
they can choose
blue
yeah but you can't choo you can't choose it when you buy it you have to choose
is it okay
yeah okay
maybe put some different ones in it doesn't matter it's just no just some led
okay cool just make it some different colours blue red and green or something


yeah we have to hurry up a bit so
okay
yeah a recharger maybe
we still want to have a recharger don't we is that still the
a recha oh no uh battery it's just a battery yeah
no just rechargeable batteries

but normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch
it's dark in the room no it's just batteries that's cheaper
yeah
yeah
definitely
but it doesn't really matter we just make it plastic
the scroll wheels that's cool that's for the volume
yeah
okay
i don't think that's an opportunity just skip it because we don't have time for that to to put it in
yeah okay
okay
oh just sk maybe you have to skip that one as well it's
no
no
yeah
but maybe the form has to be a bit different not the sh the square form just a bit
more rounded yeah
yeah
yeah that's right
so
we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these what exactly because we have to know it
so the energy uh is the recharger we already know that just a normal battery okay
the chip on print is a normal one
okay the case is just a plastic one
yeah re yeah regular yeah okay yeah regular
okay
and we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel
that's pretty much it
and a flashy light
so uh i'm not sure but we do i don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment but
yeah that's for the next one that's for th
uh that i think that's the next next meeting
but you definitely get a specific instruction
but th think about something that's more rounded just and more
it has to be
uh a bit just just on the top or on the bottom
maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this o um if you draw it like this you get a
what the fuck is it

okay mm
doesn't work you see what i mean if i draw here
it draws about four centimetres lower than nah okay just
maybe you can make it like this
and this is all the wheel for volume so that you just um it's all rounded so you can do uh turn this one yeah but just not on the top but uh on the side of it
maybe i dunno
okay so we have this at the moment
okay so we'd have this is that okay
and
like this and uh what's the channel choose where do we uh put that
still on the bottom or
that's the numbers
it doesn't make a difference if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other because you already have the volume here so you can also put it here one butt and the other one there
next to each other back and forth so you can also can put it all on the top and this you keep this empty because you have to hold it as well
but that's not want to zap very quick so
yeah
is this a opportunity or you don't want a different
why
but still the next it's still the next one doesn't make
yeah but fo from left to right is exactly the same it ma it doesn't make a big difference
but it's exactly th
i dunno i you already have the volume on the side so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake so it's uh
so but that's for that's for you 'cause it's
okay so hmm
what did what else we have to discuss about i dunno
yeah
and the led
uh yeah
yeah uh the logo was has to be on there yeah that's right
yeah five let's give five
so y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger is that is that a good good opportunity so you could put it like that okay
uh i'm not sure
but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit
that's all yeah
just round it up
no yeah yeah
no just just the corners
okay
shapes

it's a bit annoying isn't it

so we have to make a decision what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have
and you have the scroll button inside okay but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then of skip that one as well
okay yeah it's cool
rubber spongy
okay so we have s still one minute left so just i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square
no
but i i think it's still for older people you j still have older people it's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that like f whatever just you have a normal
but i it is it is it is already fancy because of the lights on the bottom of it that's already fancy uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel make it in in yellow or something just like the colours of real reaction
yeah
it's right
yeah
yeah maybe the ones we are going to draw there maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this because it doesn't work properly
so maybe you have to ask her
okay yeah that's probably
okay so just finish it so we make it a bit like m that one probably
yeah is that okay
okay only the colour and the flashy light and the we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition
or keep that it's okay but you'd definitely need a
advanced chip
so
can we just put it speech recognition in it as well okay
yeah
the function of that in there yeah
and we need a probably we need a uh advanced chip then
but it doesn't say anything about it does it
it doesn't has to say anything just you have to just talk to
okay we have to stop it now so just
okay that's a r that's that's a advanced
yeah we just decide not to put it in because it's too difficult
okay we just put it in because it's a good feature we have to stop now okay just we have to stop it now
it's it won't wake up
yeah i was a bit early like
what no i just came in uh normally i was one of them
come on
why won't it wake up
is it on
but how
ah there it is
uh
yeah i received an email as well
which one was mine
the minutes
no just tell us
yes
hmm
yeah more
well i'll i'll get back on it
spongy
spongy like sponge
uh soft materials
yeah but yeah
soft sponge
yeah but yeah how are you gonna make it
yeah
yeah i'll get back on that
well i got f also an email from
the the technology department
they have done uh research about it and uh even more possibilities now with speech so they recommended using it well
i'll check what they exact mean
so uh
yeah th that's the only problem i d they don't say how much it will cost so um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition i think it would be better to implement l c d  as well
since you have to uh configure speech thing
yeah that's that's something i dunno
yeah so uh we gotta de
we have to decide on that
mm uh
l d c  doesn't require
okay and speech recognition
advanced yeah
i'll i'll give you my design
yeah okay so we well we can
i had uh
to make a sort of a design so i did some searching on the internet i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls
i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment i think we should go more to the ipod and m p  three players mobile phones more modern y yes
um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller 'cause remote con control
you can see it here you have to bo reach both out both sides and here you just have one few
buttons so that's that's the main difference but looks uh i definitely think we should go
like this
and then changeable fonts so
it's the most important part i think but and the home base is something like that something simple
well and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit uh basic buttons on off mute and th maybe two others i dunno text buttons
yeah text button maybe there and there and then the colour buttons if we want it on i don't find it very usable but it's uh i don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well
so and then yeah we saw the the pla display in the the ipod they can put the basic buttons one two three four and uh f above ten and i think
no no that th there is no display there but it's on the place of the display and i think we should uh light this up
much more than that part so the focus is on these two parts
so you don't see all the buttons you else need
uh well um
this is how it is now um
here uh well we have volume
yeah well here we have also side scrolls
i dunno if we can use that do we want to use
for volume well then we can even simplify it more
by just putting the volume on the side and and just channel buttons here
but i think uh
well yeah well it's
basically it's it's here
they're on top
you mean uh these to the low
oh okay well yeah
mm
maybe i dunno but yeah we'll
yeah maybe it's not easy if it's below it's harder to zap so i think uh it should be
should be easy to
i think it's pretty standard these rubber buttons on the top
and uh if you don't light 'em up they don't uh you don't see 'em very good i think it's modern to light this area up and to light this area up so the focus gets on these parts and not on there
but uh the position of course can be different it's s we have to look uh what's easy to use and how it's easier to use
so we can uh switch these to i dunno if it l will look good if you put those on t on the bottom half
okay yeah maybe those two yeah and uh yeah you have to make sure it's easy to uh yes it has to be big enough so you can hold it right
well that's that's my findings so uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look m p  three player
and uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition
or something we i don't think we should put it on top then i think that if we're gonna put in more technology
that you need to be able to uh switch it open
to use
so if you put in uh speech recognition you need so more uh many more buttons which won't look good on the front side i think
so that's something we have to decide on
yeah
what we're gonna do okay
yeah well uh ipod is trendy and it is well curved square
okay so not
yeah okay not uh the old uh box look
mm yeah it's
black yellow control
yeah but uh i don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together but
yeah okay
uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts with all with the the logo on it can we do that so
yes so
yeah but with all with logo on it
yeah
well one of the options you can just like a mobile phone you can make um different fronts on it so you can just replace them i think
that was the idea or just uh release one
yeah uh or just uh sell different ones
yeah yeah
yeah i uh i dunno a more
yeah just uh
i think uh rubber really has an odd look
yeah
yeah
yeah like mobile phones like uh the ipod uh just
i dunno what uh kind of material it is but
oops
yeah
yeah
uh you can just make them around the buttons uh yeah
or it runs the whole
yeah you can halfs transparent or just that it's comes out a bit
different i think also
blue or red whatever you want it i think uh depends on the colour of the
yeah that's true but
yeah it can 'cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well
i have the mo mi i have a blinking light on my phone and i can change the colour of it
well we don't put put in any fancier technology yet so


i'm sure we can fit in
yeah
yeah okay we just
yeah we have to make sure to uh
yes yes
re recharger base station
yeah batteries yes rechargeable batteries i think's best
so if you hold it it gets powered

mm so we need uh two d 
yeah
yeah
uh for channels it's not handy because you scroll too fast
okay
uh i don't think a rubber case looks
yeah okay that uh fruit and veg or
yeah fruit and veg can be just the covers
so you can the the spongy yeah i dunno i can't imagine a soft remote control
i just can't imagine it
yeah i think titanium it's mentioned here uh
okay

yeah we have batteries
regular
yes
user interface concept
i dunno either
uh i d  and u i d  work together on prototype drawing on smart board
so we're staying here
okay so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again
yeah uh i dunno but the ipod and etcetera m p  three players mobile phones
just a bit cur okay i'll see if i can see any of those
yeah you yeah
yeah that's a little problem of course as well
yeah maybe you just have to make it uh
that's not scrollable too easy
uh wh what is the middle part
numbers okay
yeah i agree as well
use the dz
yeah that's right
yeah i think uh zapping is the highest priority and then you use those uh
yeah of course uh
yeah i i think it's
it's it's obvious i think
yeah i think
no uh i think
yeah i think it's s so simple you just
yeah okay i'll d i'll take a look at it
think we need to work uh thirty minutes again
no you have uh it is uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic you have to look at that image of the ipod
more that uh kind of style
not not the old grey black
where you can put a ve uh we have if we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo

maybe you can buy separate ones and uh
yeah um i think yeah
that's your choice i think huh
yes
yeah i think so
but th yeah that can be very simple
least
yeah just where you're around something
li yeah we had one example
mm mm
which w
here you see one that's very round
so i think that can be all kind of shapes
yeah so y you don't want uh this uh like the ipod but
more rounded
yeah i think it will just look like more like this one since it's this is also rounded i think i
yeah okay tho those are al already a bit cornered mm
yeah okay but then we have to think of something totally new
i've uh i had a lot of picture of old ones and all curves have already been done
yeah okay yeah well
yeah i know we can do a lot more but
i think it will only look more like the old remote controls
yeah
yeah okay but uh i had a lot of pictures oh i can show you here
what the old ones look like
curves curves
you've more there as well
it wasn't very small one
very simple
that is for elderly
i think if w my opinion if we just uh take the ipod and the same look so uh light or just whatever colour but the same light colours
and uh just with uh together with uh the back lights b look will look very new no rubber buttons or something just together with the back lights you'll get a totally new look more like the m p  three player m  um p  m  p  three player
yes just a simple scrollb
doesn't have to be
yeah no spongy and
mm
yeah idea but you're if you look at the way remote controls are now
and if you make it look like the ipod
yeah okay so that's already a very big change compared to
ye yeah well uh
could
no i think oh
think the scroll wheel won't be very big since if you put it uh somewhere the chances that it will scroll are too big so it will just be a small
small scroll wheel so it won't uh stick out much
yeah okay well maybe we can just open images there and i'll paint and paint
i'll be able to do a better job
bu yeah i agree more like ipod
yes just a
speech yeah do we s keep that yeah i think
well uh then it w
well that's very easy we already have uh the beeping of the home station so
uh strange that i received the information about that
so shall we it open then so we can put all the
okay
yeah
oh yeah i
no
i just i just received the
yeah
yeah our division has developed a new speech recognition feature the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit this is a very small electronic unit will give a standard answer after it recognise a question
doesn't say just you say record followed by your question sample and after a few seconds the answer uh sample
because uh
so it works like uh good morning remote control and then the remote control says good morning
yeah uh th that's just it's a no yeah it well that's integrated in the chip so if you use the speech recognition that's in it
i dunno but if we use speech recognition that will be in it as well
well it it would be would be a good feature feature
okay no no worries about the cost etcetera and there's a chip in it that will okay
okay
i received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials so i'll discuss them with you yeah

mm no
yeah
hmm
spongy
so rubber kind of
yeah

it's like a sponge
yeah somewhat like
yeah i've some uh material uh information but i'll give you it later in my presentation

hmm
hmm
yeah well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost but maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement
oh i got an email uh
and it says uh the chip can be uh simple regular or advanced and
um
they say uh a display requires an advanced chip and this is more expensive than all the other chips so it's m the most expensive
yeah it says in the email the display requires an advanced chip
yeah probably too i i haven't got anything about speech recognition but
well it d that's that's the most expensive chip we need if we're doing uh if we're doing a display
hmm
hmm
but it that's on on the display
i think it is on uh on the bottom too
yeah okay yeah i've i've got something of that uh too
scroll
yeah or uh maybe uh the channel buttons are often used and you can't use them now with your thumb because the thing is not it's not easy to control
yeah okay m maybe we cho should put that on top and buttons we we don't use on in the bottom
because uh you can't hold it you can't hold it th the control and push the buttons
but i i think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons like one two three
so maybe we can put that on the bottom
like zapping is just switching one channel at a time
yeah okay that's that's good but
yeah okay
yeah
hmm
no i think th the the top buttons are okay they sh those should be on top but uh we we can switch those two yeah
yeah
no
yeah we have to keep it simple
okay the component design
i looked at uh some similar devices and uh my own common knowledge
so uh this was on the web site if you aim at a young public you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green blue red so
flashy kinda colours uh shapes should be curved so round shapes not nothing square like
yeah
yeah but mm is uh has round corners i think so we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing
yeah
and um sports and gaming device style characteristics
i don't know exactly what that means but it should be well yeah popular kind of
looking i think
okay
yeah
yeah mm n
not that weird because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy to attract a young public
no okay that's a that's a sen
that's just a matter of tastes but
we have to use uh kind of flashy colours i think
yeah
like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and
okay
well this is a remote control a very old one
um then the components the case has just a here's black but we are making it uh
yeah i dunno
maybe
but anyways uh it should be transparent we decided that huh s
okay
yeah we could do that
yeah but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent so you can still th look through it
um the buttons normal rubber i think like normal ordinary buttons soft
with the hard hard buttons
okay
yeah it's it's all on one level
yeah on one level
yeah i know what you mean
so we have to keep it on the one level like th the top it's yeah
yeah okay
okay it's chos so that should be hard plastic then the buttons
i think or maybe
yeah
yeah
okay
and um then the l e d  the normal
infrared l e d  i think s sufficient and back light
l e d s so but i think we have to make the case transparent otherwise
the back light won't work so if you put
okay
yeah but we can still make it transparent so or no
yeah okay good and in green colour the back lights or
yeah

no but i think there are multiple colour leds so
i i know i dunno is
maybe it's it's more impor more expensive i think it's
yeah i dunno maybe it's too expensive but it i th i don't think so
then uh some more technical things
i don't know what it is but it should be there i think um
this is the normal circuit board like a chip board in in a lot of uh things
w so we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators there's all
these kind of things
um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls so i guess we j we just need that i don't know what they do or
nah but they just said we need it uh the battery contacts like normal batteries ca you can put in
yeah okay yeah but
yeah but it i we don't wanna have a ar an how do you call it accu
y uh just just batteries rechargeable batteries
okay not a separate okay and uh a chip that's this one
then uh i received some possibilities um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh like with the pulse watch so it operates on your wrist kinda
if you hold it
yeah i don't think it will work and or we can also use solar cells but you mostly use it indoors so
yeah and and we can use the home station kind of thing um cases flat
so uncurved uh two d  curved is um like front to the back
and three d  curved is also in depth
so that's possible uh but with three d  uh curved uh remote controls we must use rubber buttons so we can't use the flat buttons
yeah i think
um these kinda materials can be used
yeah i think so too
yeah scroll wheels um
yeah that's good we can use multiple scroll wheels w if we want to but i think just the volume is enough
and uh the l c d  so we need uh the expensive most expensive chip if we use an l c d 
okay then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip so th so the regular chip because we use scroll wheels
and um
yeah that was it i guess uh are are we using a a rubber case or we haven't decided yet
l yeah i it it should be soft you said so
so just hard plastic okay
titanium uh i think it's too expensive
yeah you can make it curved or mm round but just in two d  not in depth
yeah
yeah th yeah the chip is the the regular one you have the simple one regular and advanced so it's b should be regular uh the second
i think i'll just check it
yeah
mm or should we do it in the next meeting
so we should did it here
or should we do it in the next meeting
okay
yeah

what
oh
okay
like a very big scroll wheel
okay
hmm
i think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted
yeah i think it's probably better yeah but maybe we can make a a plastic so that you i if you like drop it it won't change the volume only if you use your finger
i think in middle
uh i think th the numbers should be in the bottom and and the switch channel in the middle
or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below
yeah okay
uh but i think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other so
because then it's it's easy to know m if i push the the the up
yeah but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up and down button is if you put them
but uh but i i think uh left to right is more often associated with volume and top down is more with uh channel changing
in uh on most on most remote controls so so if we use that they will probably have a long learning uh time
i dunno
okay

yeah but i i it should be round in in shape so

no tha that will be
yeah so top down hmm
do we have to design that w as well
the docking station
hmm
yeah just a recharger
but we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well
oh yeah okay
of the remote control
yeah yeah
yeah but we can we can do all kinds of uh as long as it isn is in two d  we can use all kind of round shapes
not in depth
yeah but yeah if if we want to make it
kind of yeah new

yeah but we could do a lot of lot more curving
i would do it
like in this kind of shape or
i dunno
i dunno if it's handy
this the olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing
mm
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
yeah i don't know
mm hmm
yeah
yeah though that's a trend if we want to make it but yeah i'm not a trendwatcher you are so
spongeball kinda
okay yeah i d i don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits in the hand uh stuff
yeah but we're we're aiming at a young public
hmm
yeah we could do that
yeah
s uh yeah i don't know yeah i think so and we we have to build in a microphone and
yeah and i do i don't know anything about that i d i didn't receive any information on speech recognition so
fine
yeah we probably do
no
yeah uh i have i have some some information about the cost but just a about the chip
i don't know how much but
just in inexpensive or
but i it's a separate chip

yeah i don't know anything about this but nah
i dunno

bonjour
why
okay
check check check check
the power light doesn't work you turned it off
okay
oh
hmm

uh
shall i start


no
okay well
i received an email
okay
i searched the web uh and uh i searched uh on this d document recent investigation of the remote control market it has been done in italy uh italy and in
uh another country in europe i forget it uh but uh they found out the most important
aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel so it's
very important for us to create something new so what michael just said it must be uh some
very different from ordinary uh remote controls
fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and interface
uh this uh aspect is the most important one uh it came out of the research it uh is twice important
as the following the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it
uh technological innovative
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features and then uh that uh
this is a point of discussion because we just decided that we don't make use
of uh l c d  or uh speech recognition
but um this is the second uh important uh aspect and i think uh we must use some of the new technology to be uh innovative
uh maybe maybe something new we have to discuss about it s uh okay uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls and that's very hard i think
uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use but uh that was an overall uh point
we already discussed that um i've got one picture uh
d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy
so i took uh that part of the webpage and it says uh fashion watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy yeah uh have detected the following trends
this trends i th uh trend i think it's not um that meaningful for us maybe
but it's about uh clothes and shoes but the uh the next uh aspect also
in contrast to last year the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy but
spongy what what does spongy says spongy
okay
yeah yeah it's something that uh it stand there but i didn't knew uh knew what it means so spongy means y yeah
so it's also a stress ball
uh
okay
what do i think uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control i think about changeable fronts
uh maybe a see through one in a a fruit front because it's uh it's hot and uh some basic uh colour fronts
uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something uh maybe an extraordinary
shape like a sponge uh or uh yeah just another shape than a normal
uh remote control ha uh has just uh something round in it or uh maybe not uh
not uh yeah i dun dunno we have to discuss about that
uh y yeah main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative yeah how do we do that maybe speech we ma must have some kind of gadget
so
intro yeah
yeah that's the problem that's the main problem
so
maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations
okay uh let's first watch paul's presentation first then

oh it's mass production so you can say you can
yeah but how uh we we're gonna make many of those so we can start a mass production and then the cost will still will be
yeah
okay
that was this
no i don't uh i don't like it
okay

square like
mm
oh yeah
uh uh
yeah the the the new uh new modern uh remote controls uh the buttons are part of the uh the style i think is part of the remote control itself
it it's one uh a one uh out of one shape uh it's n doesn't is
uh a button uh um how do you say it it it didn't it i
it don't come out of the on the background it is in uh the c a remote control uh
yeah

yeah
uh i
yeah but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control you
hmm


okay yeah you can you can change yeah no
ah cool
okay

okay
mm
uh but we have to do something about the trend the trend is uh spong spongy
uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh and uh now
we have nothing about uh about those those two
uh yeah i just just on front
neith uh i don't like it uh neither
yeah that's not not it's not al uh always the same every remote control's uh different
yeah we have to care that it r uh looks really new because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh
uh square uh remote control 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll wheel on the outside
yes okay
and a bit uh
some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have
uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then uh five or something or more or
and um uh uh buy the product you buy you get one and uh basic or you can choose one uh if you buy the project
yeah you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station
yeah
yeah we can b
it c it could be just just a square just a packet
yeah but that's a round one maybe we can choose then
yeah

yeah
what do we do wrong hmm just just more like this and not uh a square okay
yeah it
uh it's very annoying okay
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh the t the trend is
spongy and fruity but yeah
it's not not a lot of trends i uh i found uh
uh
it the th th
yeah
there is one
there's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original and i hope we can uh make it look not like the ipod itself it must have uh uh uh a very different
yeah they're all the same
uh yeah but uh if you the f uh front the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow
no
if you set the pen yeah he will draw here
doesn't work
yeah i'll see it
uh
no
oh that's hard but
uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said
we have to be original and uh technological innovative becau yeah but
ma
but we don't have any f information about the cost
we started with information about the cost was now th
and how much is the chip the the the
and how how does it work is it
no does it say does it say something back

okay
um
yeah
fine
mm hmm
uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can i mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall
um
okay
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm yeah
yeah
yeah and that's it
mm
mm hmm
mm
yeah
mm yeah
mm hmm okay
rooms yeah and do we need a room like a reading room or yeah
mm
okay
yeah
mm yeah
mm
the first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh i mean it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then
for the other
yeah but at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the
other because i was thinking uh gisella is quite i mean gile gisella's work is quite noisy because it's
secretary so yeah lot of phone call and stuff like that so yeah so you won't share an office with
gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent gisella is working which is
another condition
yeah mm
so i don't know maybe we can decide that gisella is having one of the one person room
mm
yeah
yeah but at least the thing we know that gisella is gonna be alone
or with equipment but
humanly alone yeah
yeah
yeah
and then i think the main discussion we should have is
um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title
or yeah or yeah couple of professor and assistant or
that's more a conceptual question than a practical question
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah mm
mm yeah
yeah yeah but we will have this reading room which can be
mm
yeah for a real meeting
mm
yeah
mm
no
yeah
mm yeah
mm yeah the other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because
marianne and i interact a lot with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that so it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and so it's maybe
yeah so maybe it's not really nice to have to share an office with somebody like us having a lot of social life and
yeah
mm
yeah
mm
yeah i dunno
yeah mm mm
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that and make plans with that because
yeah
mm
yeah
mm hmm
i don't know
yeah
one point i can say by experience it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office
plus the computers so
yeah so we might be it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary
a room with three people a working room
oh yeah mm oh yeah
okay
yeah
yeah yeah
so the other solution is to say okay we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for or
but avoiding
having three person full time in a same room could be a good idea i think
yeah
mm
so for the reading room we will have a two person room
okay
yeah
which one
with the mountain
yeah it's
big black stripe is the windows not the thin one between the big but what about the d the other one which has only one windows but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet
we have electricity so
i hope
no it's a question i mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and
yeah we are on the sixth floor
yeah and stop reading
so it's a relaxing room
yeah yeah no okay
yeah yeah
mm yeah yeah
mm so what about one of the room in the corner so you have three windows it's even better
but you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that
if you intend the reading room being more a library or
mm
yeah
mm
yeah mm
yeah
kind of yeah small library
no no no no no no sure but yeah
mm
so are we all agree about these two person rooms
which one corner or not corner
the middle one okay
yeah mm
okay
mm hmm
so we can exclude this one to make an office
or maybe write on the board i don't know
so we have the map and

it's alright
three yeah
yeah yeah mm
so
okay
is that a mountain okay
and that an old town
yeah should we decide also the administration stuff and
so we exclude the n the thing we are quite sure and then we discuss the
that's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration
yeah that just imply you expect people to come when gisella is not working and that's not really fair if you
so we can put gisella in the two people room
which is near the mailbox
no

i don't know
i it's just the question you always have the phone ringing even if the af even when she's not working
yeah
yeah but that's that's a good point from nikos to say that she needs to be n near the mail box and the printer and
and the photocopier and stuff like that
yeah exc except the door is not really
convenient
no but i think if if the main um how can i put that the mm
if the main reason to put to to choose gisella's place is the proximity of the mailbox it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room
otherwise we have a one people room and
yeah
yeah no but it's it's also it's also the place of the photocopier

yeah
because if we put the photocopier near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that
yeah
yeah oh no
yeah no it's too
and it's too big and
yeah okay
and then we can for the moment put gisella in this corner room if you agree i don't know
yeah
but this option of putting gisella near the photocopier
i mean she is not sharing an office i mean sh we put some trainee
in gisella's office because there is a spare room and that's quite imp yeah
that's quite uh i mean that's quite important to keep a spare room in gisella's office
if we need more staff but
i wouldn't work in gisella's office

yeah yeah
mm yeah
for example and there is no room in the cupboards for any people except gisella because she got lots of paper archives and files and stuff like that so it's really she needs
space
mm yeah
hmm
yeah
are you sure it's southwest i dunno if thi if this map is a
okay the map is north oriented okay no
okay i don't know
anyways yeah but
okay you know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not no sorry until but

okay
no because sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine sunrise and sunset is quite also a good um
something to take into account
uh northeast
sunrise
it's east yeah east no east
we we have sun in the morning only
so it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one
let's say that
it's it's the one you have of now you both
more or less
you get the sunset then no and it's really warm and
do you uh by the way is it a six floor building or is there more
okay so it's warm
mm okay
mm
so how many rooms
and uh how many place do we have
yeah plus one spare place but really the last place to be used
yeah
okay
we got two three four six nine
fourteen places
for fourteen people
yeah
t okay
bless you

so
can we group people by their name i to marianne so it's gonna be mariannes' office
yeah that's going that can be that's boring but that can be a good idea but do do we can we do that because there is no we can't because no we can't there is two
and two three person room
yeah so
mm yeah yeah
yeah
i think we clear the things a little bit up too s yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
so let's have a break save your file
you have x p 
that's nice
okay so as you guys know f issco is too small well the building is too small for
our group so we're moving to a new building uh it's gonna be the building across the street and we're actually moving
in three weeks but the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office
in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer the fax machine all the big equipment
and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment and they want to know
where we're gonna do all this by november second
so that means basically next tuesday and since we don't really have any
other time we have to make these decisions today what we're getting is nine rooms for a
maximum of eighteen people which is okay 'cause there's only fifteen of us and all the rooms have windows luckily so
there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't um there's two views either of the old town or the mountains
and the rooms have various sizes there's two three people rooms five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building so you actually
get windows on two walls and two one person rooms
that's pretty much what the building looks like um and then you have the number of people per room the courtyard
because we're on the sixth floor you can't actually go out to it but it just means that the windows look out onto open space
um you can see the bathrooms the elevators are sort of further down the hall the
purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mail boxes all
of the windows open you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building
and the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like i said the photocopier which is really big the fax
machine which is not so big and the printer which is relatively big
each office has a white board a bulletin board and a coat rack no cupboards like we have in the current
offices and each person gets their own chair their own corner desk so like the n the ones that
we have now um a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small i mean they're about that tall
and one sort of hanging shelf so we don't get the bookcases like we have now but just one shelf that's attached to
the wall
and the people that we have to place uh you can see the list there along with
their position and the project that they work on and i guess the question the first question is
how we want to organise people whether we want to do it by rank or by project
or
i don't know put all the p h d  students together all the professors together that sort of thing
so the idea is that we come up with a plan there's another group who's gonna be working
on the same plan later this week and then andre and i have to do presentations for
the university administrators on the second so we have to come up with a plan
possibly if we have time a presentation a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best
okay
so anyone have any ideas or
i guess
yeah um i think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building so as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed then it should be okay to leave them in the hall
it's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documents or n whatever
um well we get one sort of networked printer and then i think some of us have personal printers i think susan has a personal printer gisella has one maybe
i can't remember who else yeah but no one else gets their own printer in terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now
um
so what i'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and
then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as
to exactly where to put people
does that work oh and on the map the little half circular well quater
circles are doors which i'm assuming you've figured out but just in case and there's just the one room
that actually has two doors going into it the the three person room on the right yeah
yes yeah a lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room
so we should leave a space for that and we can because like i said maximum eighteen
people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us and i don't know if you've noticed but two of us
are only here half the time so martin and david um are half the time at the e p f l 
and half the time in geneva so
sort of keep that in mind i guess when
you are doing the actual planning
yeah
mm hmm yeah
but gisella's really the only administrator yeah
yeah
yeah
and she's always moving around
no
yeah
which i don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them
yeah either that or maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or
like with the the photocopier or maybe not the photocopier but the printer
yeah yeah
and not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker
yeah i mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this
yeah yeah that makes sense to put the fax in there
uh
so
yeah
yeah
well the third option is just completely mix everyone up which some people say is better sort of for a
group environment so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project right so if you share an office with someone
who's on a completely different project you find out about that project but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis
yeah
i think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting but if
it's empty then sure you can use it for a meeting there's nothing wrong with that but i think if someone's already reading in there it's not fair
to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting 'cause
but if you're having a short meeting you don't really
make an appointment for it you just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever
'cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal
yeah
mm hmm
yeah and the other marianne too so there's three of you
well but then you either share offices with each other which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time
so you're still going to have
like unless you get individual offices i don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that
'cause even if each of you share with a professor then it's the same thing for the professor
but it is something to keep in mind
unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight
no
no but you sort of see people's patterns i mean
even if it's not always like that i mean if it's like that you know eighty per cent of the time then
but you're right we can't make assumptions too much
i think
well it's up to us how we do it i can see benefits of both
but
yeah plus the computers
and we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office
yeah that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room
then everyone has an office right 'cause it's maximum eighteen
so take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen and you're right if we do have a stagieur whoever who comes in then we have nowhere well we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
or again find people who don't work the same hours
it doesn't completely solve the problem but
yeah i think so
a one person'll be too small anyways
the one on the bottom
yeah
two well which w there's three two person rooms
that has two windows
which is fine and still a big room
yeah so i should have explained that
yeah but then you get don't get a lot of light
for reading
really
that's
i dunno i like the idea of looking out over
lots of space
well i mean that that's the whole point right it's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space

yeah we could do that
yeah
we have some shelves like cabinet type shelves for the reading room but it's not really intended to be a library i mean we have
an i t  library um but
the other idea is to take 'cause right now we all have bookshelves so one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people put them all into that room so it becomes sort of
a mini library but not like a library system library just go and borrow your collegues' books
i think the middle one
yeah it's also sort of m central to the layout so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to
it's not that it makes that much of a difference but
why not
uh
yeah
actually what i can do is
yeah um actually that's a good idea j just put it up
yeah

so
this really isn't to scale but oh well
um
that's really not to scale um so we've got an office there
and there's
two and one
is that all
okay so this is
that and this becomes the reading room right
yes
sure
yeah
okay

but if gisella works fifty percent and they work fifty percent
that's true
yeah
but
just
does gisella have her own printer
well if you put her in in this room here it's relatively close
true
yeah
i don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail she actually brings it to your office it's more the i t  administration that uses our mailboxes
that's true
yeah
yeah unless you put it into an office which is just an annoying i think 'cause even if you put it into gisella's office it's gonna be
yeah
so
mm
at the beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms
okay
yeah
well she's go ahead
stagieurs in there
and they are not really in a position to complain
yeah
i think it's just a question of work conditions like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months then you can put up with it but if you're there you know for the full year
mm hmm
yeah
yeah in there if they need to go
yeah
yeah
south well southwest if that's north
southwest for us no tha well i'm assuming that's what you meant right that
but that's southeast anyways

this office right that's
no i i'm very bad at orienting where's north in geneva i always get it wrong but i just assumed nikos was talking about the orientation here
oh that's true
so wait we face the old town we face the old town now and we are facing
northeast
okay so
this is northeast
yeah
mm hmm
this one
it's the oven
yeah we're the top floor
yeah
it the building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now we're just getting more space this way because we couldn't move in the other building 'cause it was occupied by the other departments
actually why don't i change it on here as well
so that's gisella
plus fax
and then this is the reading room
oops
um
so that leaves us with what six eight fourteen places which is
for f yeah no for fourteen 'cause gisella's already got a room
excuse me okay um
so i'm gonna take gisella off of
that list as well i'll put her in grey i guess

that's boring
can we
no
we have we have one extra one person office and
two three person offices yeah plus we have the two people who aren't there now
that we have to put somewhere
we can keep some of the people together that are together now but
not everyone definitely
well why don't we take a break and go off and think about it
and then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it 'cause if we just sit here and discuss it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and
alright so
yeah
yep
mm hmm okay
mm hmm
alright
we can put it mm hmm
mm
okay
'kay sure yeah
that's a good idea
ad administrator
yeah that would be
maybe convenient
with someone
yeah and with someone who is who is fifty pro percent
yeah okay mm hmm
typing machine
yes yeah
or uh yeah professor assistent or uh
or uh yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
mm mm
but still i find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe i don't know if it's uh
for other people who is not working on the same project yeah that's true that's that's true yeah
you can u mm hmm
meeting about the project
mm hmm
yeah hmm
people coming and going
yeah we don't
yep yeah
mm
yeah it certainly is
plus the com mm hmm
yeah but if there are people coming in i mean we have these people working for uh two months
who comes in the summertime or something i th think we should reserve a little bit space
for them too so uh
it's quite big
mm
for soemthing yeah mm
yeah that's yeah certainly is
maybe that would be good


on the sixth floor i don't know
yeah if you are if you are reading

do so yeah
why not yeah
a library down downstairs mm
in the middle yeah
oh it's g good enough

and uh gisella
we thought a one person room
person room

or f
yes yes she does
and the place where we all pass kind of

it should be some central place
yeah that's a good idea
i it yeah so for example now if uh we reserve
yeah yeah but we can uh reserve so if you reserve a two people room we can put uh trainees
further on if they are in the same room
in the corner
south
southeast yeah that's southeast


north

when do we have sun
but s

well there is a quite a lot of sun
y yes and no it's yeah it's really warm that's
yeah yeah that's true
okay mm hmm
okay good p so
and next
so we have reserved now two two person rooms
mm hmm
for fifteen people
yeah yeah yeah

marianne marianne yeah why not
yeah that would be fun
that's boring
no we don't
okay



so we only get one printer for fifteen people
the three person room
mm
yeah i w i would suggest that too yeah
okay so th that's a one person room but we don't know how how big they are or it's hard to tell i mean gisella has this funny uh typing uh thing yeah
computer fax
so probably sh she should get the fax right
'kay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there can reserve it for meetings

well the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some
short meeting and discuss some issues or maybe we shouldn't call
it reading room but
so people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and

yeah that's a good idea yeah
yeah everybody agrees on that yep
how about how about this room
yeah at the bottom in the middle with a view to the mountains yeah it has three windows so i think it's uh two
o one two
the the middle one
two
oh the big oh ah okay


me too
yeah and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there you know quick meetings always get longer
i don't know

i was thinking of maybe we should assign gisella into this three person office
because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes then we could have gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three
person room
well th
they're fifty per cent yeah

well i mean it
w yeah we could
we could i mean i don't know how noisy she is it's uh


convenient for her yeah
okay it's fine with me
yeah it's it's not the m
yeah yeah
y
okay we should write this down do we agree that the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes
yeah what with
i mean she is sharing an office right now and i has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or

okay
yeah that's true
she needs spaces okay
okay so gisella at this southwest office
yeah yeah that that one yeah
oh right yeah that's southeast yeah it's
yeah this office yeah
uh yeah i was just talking about uh here on the map

the three people room or

you get lots of sun during summer yes
plus spare yeah
we got
for fourteen people

yeah
so we are good


alphabetically
is is any is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation so we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building

okay
so let's start then top to bottom maggie
susan
so how long is
here we go welcome everybody um i'm abigail claflin you can call me abbie
's see powerpoint that's not it there we go so this is our kick off meeting um
and i guess we should all get acquainted let's shall we all introduce ourselves
i think we'll get around to that yeah so this is just introductions yeah
okay i forgot to s say i'm the project manager but i figured you all knew that already um so
okay
um so f here's our agenda for today um we're gonna do some tool training project plan and discuss
then close um so
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original trendy and
user friendly and to do this we have to
um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing
so we'll get to that oh there it is right functional design
conceptual design and detailed design so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering
these things um so we're gonna try out our white board
if we'll all draw our favourite animal to sum up the characteristics of that animal
okay

yeah both yeah
any volunteers does anyone know what they wanna draw
i don't think so

a dolphin 's like playing pictionary
so what characteristics do you like about your animal

they're graceful
sleek
i don't know how intelligent that one looks
yes does anybody else wanna draw their animal

uh oh there goes the ten it's a cat

do you wanna anything i dunno if the the ah
a horse
that's very good
yeah
this cord's
uh right actually i haven't thought of anything yet uh
it's a pig so i'm thinking we should design a remote control that's
water resistant strong and furry what do you think yeah
this is yeah well like a cat you know soft yeah
although uh i'll just put there right
oh my gosh this is disastrous
sorry about that
okay so moving on our selling price
goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro
so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland we're in some european country
um and we will hope to sell this internationally
um selling price is twenty five euro profit aim fifty million euro
anyone a mathematician
so f that's a fifty percent um uh
um i don't know what these mean because i didn't actually make the slide show
experience with remote control so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with
remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in
a convenient practical
nice remote control um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have
yeah
yeah i mean you have it for the portable phone so why not yeah
what if it had something like um
just like a magnet on the back of it and you could i mean j just to have
some place to put it besides like a base you know like a portable phone has a base
like just to have a home for it 'cause people just stick it on top of their t v  but
the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the t v  so
yeah

yeah
maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm
yeah
do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose or does that not factor in
like
hand hand held size yeah
not not huge but
huh

little homing device um
okay so what do we think this remote control should
five minutes
till the meeting oh right this is what we have left
um oh we just
yeah
you what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions like the way a mobile phone does
so you could like um like if you have i dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels you can
the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme so you can programme like
your favourite channels so like if you had a s
that's something we could decide mm
yeah
yeah
right
yeah yeah
mm
yeah i mean we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device
um but it's something to think about yeah i mean we'll have to see how much that would be
yeah
oh i was just
yeah
maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it like so you can clip it to your like that's another
um we should probably start wrapping up um we've got some initial ideas that we
can all look into um and come up with some new ones for the next meeting which will
be in another thirty minutes um
so
yeah the
industrial designer what does that stand for i d  yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design
so i guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of
thing the
something what is the u i  yeah what does it stand for again user interface designer so that's gonna be
more technical i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
yeah yeah
um i guess you'd have to find out
mm
and the m e  what does that stand for m
marketing right um
so we'll be working on the user requirements um
yeah so i guess that wraps it up i'll see you all in thirty minutes
i just did

i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer







suppose i can draw an animal yeah
yeah
i don't know they sleep all day they're easy to draw
i think the pen is running out of





two million

oh yeah




well that's why it's always in the couch



no it really wouldn't be




yeah i agree b  button and the f  button they don't do anything


yeah i think so
user
the working design is the structure

um
it was in the email i wrote down what mine were
marketing

i'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer
so you want us to draw it and then talk about it or just draw it
okay why don't we do both right
mm i gotta think about it for a second like uh
does it have to be functional trendy and user friendly
um
okay i'll draw i'll draw one
make sure my things here
uh oh
right
okay my favourite animal is see

oops
yeah it's
yeah i guess it has a fin on top too yeah
it's my dolphin
i like its tail um no i think dolphins are really uh i
dunno they're smart and they they're cute and
they like swimming and that's cool like they're graceful yeah and they're so
yeah they're sleek and they look intelligent and i don't know they're i guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing
yeah he he doesn't look that smart he's a i dunno um
they're i think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the
th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh
look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and
they're mammals but they swim



and the pen's dying
horse
and furry
textile tactile tactile remote control
you're dragging a you have a tail
sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again
okay
i was thinking that too i think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you
i mean you always know where your t v  is so just have a call button i've always wanted that so like you can push a button on your t v 
yeah yeah yeah yeah so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control
yeah yeah
yeah i don't yeah i mean it but like i mean just i mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate it can light up and make noise and i dunno
yeah yeah or if it had a yeah
yeah i mean
yeah
yeah in in the couch i dunno it seems like though that that would be hard 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and
yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls
yeah
yeah
bigger
hand sized
it can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it
or like or like a light thing you know i dunno yeah
or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah that would be really
i'm sure we could do that for twenty five euros a pop yeah uh
i also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons 'cause i hate that when they have too many buttons and i mean i know it has to have enough functions but like i don't know you just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like no you never use half of them so
that would be cool
yeah i mean it just seems like yeah
i guess they would go together somehow i dunno
i'm thinking kind of
or like you h you see those you know people i'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those
these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic and they have like this one master control
that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like
so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen i don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive
though t like i dunno
yeah yeah yeah that's true
mm
well i guess we have to get to that later yeah

furry

yeah mm mm
yeah
that's me
uh user interface design
so technical function
what is technical functions exactl i i don't really know what

it does but it i just don't really
yeah
what effect should the thing ha should it have okay alright and working design okay
yeah yeah alright and how it works okay right i'm i'm on task
hi i'm chiara i'm the um marketing expert um would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later
we'll get round to that later my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert
i think both
who starts we ought to decide who starts and all that no uh huh
uh yeah well i had the cat as well but uh i've got a spare one
so i'll use the spare one
um but it's harder to draw um
um
uh
um i don't really know how the legs go but anyway i will do that
um and the main reason is they're pretty i think they're very pretty and they go well
with the environment and i like the way they run and i used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice
animals and i like the way um they feel sort of under
under the hand i think that's pretty much it um


how many should we sell then um a lot two two two million two mi no more f four million
four million and it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty that'll do four million
it is a lot uh
um i think one thing is that it should be easy to find bec yeah bec
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
and even i think a little light um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing i dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa
in which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound i don't know if it's expensive maybe to
maybe call is enough but yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah


but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing a pretty object attached to the wall but that
would really make it more expensive but it's only a plastic thing r really
the thing on the wall something like that and the other thing is
not well it needs to be sort of
yeah i don't think you need a
but definitely not well i don't know
no it can't be uh uh
like spaceship right um
oh dear
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
select uh
but would you have the screen on the thing or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen
because
because i don't know if it's i think it's e expensive if you have if you use the telly screen
'cause the telly's already a screen then you can pro sort of have a programming function really easy
sort of arrow up and down on the remote and then use the telly as a screen
but um
but yeah for sure something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do is that what you mean
right mm
yeah
but like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap
yeah
or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's
um yeah and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um
what was the word water resistant
no but it's i thought ah spot on good feel tact tactile good tactile feel maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot
that's quite annoying
yeah clip
ooh
um
it says on that email but it
it said um
it said
yeah like
be a medium between you and the telly i think that's uh
marketing oh it's written here but um
okay
uh welcome back after lunch i hope uh you had a good lunch
together
for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the
conceptual design meeting
okay and the agenda will be
the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the christine and uh
agnes and from mister ed
and finally in this meeting we have to decide
and we are to take a decision on the remote control
concept and uh the functional design
so we have forty minutes i think it's uh
little bit uh low but i i hope we can finish it up so i'll handle to the
the functional team to the christine okay to discuss about uh the components concept
you're number two
'kay
the next one




can you go back uh one slide

yes uh question uh what's mean exactly advanced chip on print what's the meaning of that
mm hmm
yeah is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro proc micro processor based or uh
okay tha that would be great so if you find out from the technology background okay so that would be good
so so you're not convinced about the the wood yes
yeah so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh what about yo you
yes in t yes in term in terms of comments first
okay then uh let's move to agnes
s you're
you are in participant three
this one





so what's your uh the comments or uh
s
okay
mm hmm
yeah





the
yeah
i hope so

yeah

yeah but we can get a production in uh countries like uh india yes yes countries like india or china or malaysia so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more
so
yeah yeah so
yes
so
yeah so
yes uh but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later okay depends on the the quantity okay
so we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something so we can have a tie up with who the
do the fabric okay for the different uh electronics items then we can have a business tie up and
to get to cut the cost okay to sell more
so but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept okay if is acceptable for both of you what uh ed was talking
and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple so
yeah

yes


i don't think so
yes
yes
don't looks nice uh
yeah so uh what we'll do is uh we will stick with the the simple design for time being until
uh th ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra in case we go for the display okay
so maybe what you can do is uh both of you you can come up with the the prototype
okay the model okay


yeah i hope if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design okay then they can show you how it looks like and then we can uh submit to the i will submit to the management okay
then meantime you can come up with the price how much it's cost as extra for uh the display an and the marketing strategy that's very important okay
yes
how much you can
how mu how much how much you can sell extra
of course you'll make money too so it
it's not only pay out you make money too your commission
okay so any questions
so by next meeting so please come up with the the prototype okay then uh then we can proceed from there
it's okay so thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again and see you soon then okay thank you
mm hmm





at least it's environmentally friendly


thank you yeah

why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material
mm hmm
whic
which

although i think
i think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems wouldn't you i mean it chips it if you drop it uh it's i'm not su

i think if you re if you use really good quality wood then it might work but you can't just use
yeah exactly yeah


the stain

um in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own

y yeah

i think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles
too much which you'll see with my presentation one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how
quickly the novelty wears off of having uh yeah for example
so have to see how kid friendly it is and and all that
but


sure

one point three yeah
uh yeah
i think so yeah
yeah that's the one so it's a very short presentation 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so
if you want to just go straight to the second slide um which basically shows sort of i took
the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that
y you can actually see on it are the on off switch volume and channel control the menu access button
ergonomic shape which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold
than the r standard very straight remote controls and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising
idea is that people can actually do sort of quasi measurements on their hand size so if someone has larger hands
you have a wider remote control
so that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting
is to put a flip screen on it just like you have on flip phones so that you don't have this case where someone
sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing
the buttons while you're trying to watch a t v  show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off and also
um you had issues with the batteries running out so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer
and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die and in terms of invisible features audio
and um tactile feedback on button presses and like you said speech recognition
so in terms of what this thing would actually look like
despite working in interface design i'm not the greatest artist in the world so you'll have to forgive me

you'd have something like this with an on off switch fairly big sort of in the corner and by itself so you don't accidentally turn your t v  off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for oops
channels and volume sort of for surfing channels and then volume so the volume would be the up and down 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right and then here you'd have your sort of standard telephonish
number pad
and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t v  and
on the other side a way to turn off the voice control so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice
they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you

um so again you can have a little l c d  light somewhere the flip
thing and have i forgotten anything
i don't think so so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted to keep
is keep it simple not have too many buttons not have too many functionalities thrown into it think the design can pretty
much carry over to everything although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something
slightly different
yeah but you also have to d start watching out for the weight 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight
of the remote control you don't want it to start getting too heavy but that's the general layout with the general functionalities
if we come up with something else as you can see there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if
you do it customisably you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large depending on
personal preferences
so that's pretty much all i had to say i mean everything else in terms of design issues um the centering of the key pad and
the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control
and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding
the remote control the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently
so once we decide exactly what we want then we can figure out the exact positioning but more or less i think it should go along those lines

mm hmm
yeah

no no

mm hmm
yeah

right
especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm

oh yeah
yeah so it's really molded to to your specific

but th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote
the sales yeah

yeah
well already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick
yeah
yeah
and that took off yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
i think it depends i mean i think it's a good idea but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t v  you already have a big display right in front of you
so if we're trying to keep costs down then maybe sacrificing the display
is a way to go i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for 'cause if it's only used for one little thing then putting in a big display case or a big display that's
probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever may not be the most cost efficient way to go but
that's just sort of speculation i mean
mm hmm

what about the buttons would
would the buttons be wood too or
mm hmm
okay
sure






no
okay mm hmm
okay
okay so uh if you could open the powerpoint presentation i'm number two
components design there we go
so uh can we put it in slide show mode yeah
right here is that little that one yes please thank you i'll take the mouse
so uh
we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components
uh the case the power supply uh the means of communications with the
television set in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have microphone
well no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device but um maybe you do
have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um
so it could be in the television set could be in the device but somewhere you have to put the microphone um and
a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost um so
the other w thing that we so our method for going about this is we've looked at
uh the histo hi historical record what's worked what hasn't and then we also um
we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because course
we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities
to offer us so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research
so um for the case um we told we were making a specifica specific
assumption that it would be curved in design course you know i wanted it to be expandable and
shrinkable but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non option
we can uh we can really seriously explore so then we were thinking about um rubber
but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and
th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's
uh goes with the board
uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after
a while so um we still had titanium and and wood available but um unfortunately
uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make
d curved cases out of titanium although how apple did it with th powerbook
i'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood
so this is our finding and a as she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material
so we're we're currently uh proposing uh we'll get to all my personal preferences
in just a second so then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board
but uh these simple chips but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple
one and um then there was the regular which i regret that i've
forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one uh the other option
was this advanced chip on print and uh we liked th we we found that
it it includes this infrared sender which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding
the right chip
and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor
and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print so uh
we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i'd
really think we should you know use some of uh some really exotic woods like um you know
uh well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods
i think that people will might really want to design their own cases you see they could do
sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their orders kinda like you submit a custom
car order you know and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather
and things like that and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone
and speaker on the advanced chip so this is the findings of our research and
my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have
um have it be made out of wood do you have any problems with that
i'm not sure how do i oh i know let's see let's go back up here
i think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board
uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting

i don't know but i'll find out more at our next meeting
sounds good
because um it gets brittle
cracks
um
we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years
so good ex good expression
i don't know speak for yourself i'm planning to be around for a while

you're what
you think
and you could you could sell oils with it to take care of it
well i'm glad you

okay good sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face

mm hmm
mm

she works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this luckily ed was not

mm hmm yeah you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your
it's really good if your dog gets ahold of it they can use it for teething
yeah they do it with other materials as well yeah
oh i'm sorry
right my hand is uh different size than yours for example
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
a hinge
be like a copper hinge or you know
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm mm hmm


mm hmm
mm
mm hmm


sure
no f go to findings


context sensitive instructions depending on what the tel what mode the t v  or the d v d  or something else is in

you know maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like
um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber
um ball and then they would squeeze it and it would take the shape of their hand
to t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh
yes you'd know what kind of wood to get
that's right that's right you wouldn't wanna go too far down that
oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect yeah


mm hmm

right mm
we'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes we might wanna um learn about um labour laws
you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap but you don't wanna exploit uh labour
in um third world countries so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're
uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working
wage to the person who made the device
cost of living is low
good well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
mm hmm
what do you think ed do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed um do you know how much it costs um to to add a little display like this uh

do you wanna take an action item to go find out
okay
sorry about that



so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've
we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation and um i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case
a customisable and

uh i don't think so no i think they could be rubber like they are now so you have that tactile experience of
so um are we done with this meeting

and a marketing strategy




















wow good expression well after us


actually i'm ready to sell it i'm ready to sell it
no y no no no the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard extremely hard wood but there are some very pretty woods out there
that's actually very innovative idea

well it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood your type of wood
i mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised individualised speech recognition remote control in wood that's not on the market

in turns of wow
wood




they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic so and chew 'em up
and chew 'em up





no
hmm
simple design
it's what consumers want
it's almost like houston we have a product here problem is obviously gonna be cost
okay i also have a f very simple presentation because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want
i also have uh copied a
different type of remote
if you can find me where i'm at
there should only be one in here trend watch
it's being modified they're stealing our product
we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for
today 'cause uh trends change very very quickly in six months maybe this idea is already
gone out the window so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act uh they already erased
the rest of mine huh
no no no no
'cause i had another comment there uh the market trend this is what we know from the last uh from
the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done fancy and feel good that's what we've been looking for something that
feels good in the hand that's easy to use looking for next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now
they're all very similar they all do the same thing we have to have something completely different okay easy to
use has always has become has become another major interest that uh with the whiteboard we can see that it's a
remote that's easy to use
and i think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology so
even if we have a product that may be more expensive if it comes out right if they
look it looks and feels good and has technology the second two you can see the last one is a very
easy simple design the second one there is about uh forty five thousand different buttons
on it which makes it fairly hard to read uh very hard to use the first one i see that they put in a display
now there's something else uh with the little flip up now we're adding all kinds of things in but with the little flip up if you have a little display on the flip up that when you close it everything is locked maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes when you're looking for buttons maybe if you see a display
okay
because i've seen mostly the standard ones yeah now you have it now you have one with the very simple also the idea is simple but with a display so you can see what you're doing so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use
trendy fancy feels good
uh with a display
wood designer wood designer colours we might've
mm hmm
how hard they squeeze resistance resistance right
no but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market totally different and from

although what it was it uh it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours right you take it apart and put on another face take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions millions
so so say with the f with the findings with the research easy to use something totally new we have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market

where w where it would be manufactured is is
another step we're here to design
come up with a nice product

no no no p spec it's 'cause we have to find out cost on it
um no that's no problem i'm here for the pushing it after it's made i will market it once we get a price on it then we can market it

nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case
and marketing strategy thank you fired


'kay
hmm
okay everybody welcome to the detailed design meeting um
let's see our agenda last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness
of our remote controls and how we might pursue that um and i think looks like we've
come up with some ideas um and we also talked about materials we'd use
and what kind of chip would be necessary um so for later in the meeting i've
done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that um
and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it um
so actually i think
yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of

oh is that broccoli

's a very bright strawberry

oh yeah
yeah

oh
um if you wanna look in your project documents folder there's an excel spreadsheet
um the only one that's in there production costs and if you open it up
um i've just stuck the numbers in it was a real challenge there but if i missed anything
that we've gone over or if you see something that has changed
i mean we decided on batteries and the regular chip would be necessary for the
more advanced ipod like button um
i said uncurved or flat i think that's what you have there is that right for the for the plastic part would be
oh okay
right
well yeah if we're talking about the area just oh i d
i dunno i guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see
um so what else there's plastic for that area around the button
um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right um and lots
of special colours actually uh scroll wheel do you see anything
that i've missed
okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine which is even less than twelve point five which means we'd be making even more of a profit and if we sold a lot of squishy things boo yeah
okay
s
so
mm
did y what did you work on the
okay do you wanna
okay i think that's
huh the powerpoint one
yeah
um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do
wait one is true and so these are the questions we're answering and one is
one right okay
if it's somewhere in between you put four okay

are we just about ready
i don't think so it's yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we
our animals will forever be there
un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay we'll
five

i i think we should
yeah yeah
six i wasn't cheating i swear
uh
oh i thought it was the other way round so we do have about the same thing we just have it the other way

oh gosh okay well
yeah
yeah
yeah
three
two
one
two
two point i think i missed two wait is that two point one
one point four one point five okay right that's i have two of them
one
yeah yeah
three
three
two
five
four
two
okay um
no no that's um i think we should look at the ones that like
where s where people said four where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing
an aspect of the remote
the that was material
mm
um
mm hmm
does the shape
see i'm having i'm having trouble imagining
the is it uh gonna be the size like the the controller it or bigger
because

yeah
no but i imagine even if it was bigger like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are
long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers
um but i don't s i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit
there like it's an awkward position
yeah
and would it even resemble fruit that way i mean
yeah
yeah

yeah that i i when you were holding that before it actually looked yeah

yeah
what if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber
you know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah
or i mean we could even have fruit like around i mean
but if we if we need yeah and if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow there might be i mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the
mm
yeah
yeah
well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that which is a nice kind of yeah
but
i mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape 'cause like kind of
yeah yeah or like even
or even like
yeah like you said like a joystick like that you know
'cause that i think
i mean that fits the whole round ipod idea and you still have the comfort of holding it like that
and you could like if it's like this you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part
but i mean it do we have any other ideas about that
the batteries are going in the back
the reason i i ga i didn't give it a one i think i gave it a three because i thought you'd have to like unc clip no you could
just like any other one okay yeah
right
okay
mm

okay


yeah
and it would probably cost more to produce 'cause they're irregular
yeah
which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit
mm

not really
well we've done finance evaluation criteria production evaluation um so project evaluation
i guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh oh it's alright uh yeah um
did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of
yeah
i mean fruit and squishiness how c more creative can you get
and how was our leadership and teamwork
well i thought my leadership was crap personally excuse me am i allowed to say that yeah um
yeah well i'm never gonna do a management position i know that now um yeah i thought we all worked very well together
yeah
yeah very democratic
no spats that was good um and the means for like the materials we used how convenient were they
like the the pens the whiteboard i mean we used
are you a mac person
huh

mm
yeah
yeah
i can't say i found everything particularly helpful like i
it
really
i mean m my problem yeah yeah 'cause my problem was you guys had access to like they'd
put send you to sites and stuff right see i couldn't do that so i didn't really know what you guys were doing and when you were talking about
it i was just like you know that's wh that's why i seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things 'cause i
yeah
yeah
system yeah
yeah
yeah huh
yeah
yeah
well i mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know so it's
oh right given certain information or
just yeah
mm mm
what do you guys think of the pens it asks about that
mm
yeah and i i've f forgotten once or twice to check the box
mm
and new ideas found yeah
mm
yeah

yeah
yeah
seems kind of like an excessive reiteration yeah
yeah
yeah

well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time any other ideas for
um we still have time if there's any other input i mean the i think we did really well personally which is why we've
you know gone through this so quickly 'cause i mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory it fits the budget and it's trendy so
um
so i think that's all for today
meeting adjourned
yeah
so i guess we're supposed to write final reports 'cause
i don't know hmm
hmm or is that just me
okay well um so our design looks something like this
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever this is a button serves as the power button if you hold it down and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu
and uh the base of the remote control which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel is interchangeable
so you can change the colour according to your to suit your living room or whatever and it comes
yeah i can change the vegetable this one's broccoli so this snaps off and you can put on
whichever one you want this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it
this is a mango the it's trendy fruit it's not just ordinary fruits you don't have orange you have mango um i guess strawberry's not as trendy but
so we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control
and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them because they'll need to switch 'em out
mm hmm
well the locator is just chip that's inside there
and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere
yeah we didn't design that
but it would be coordinating with that of course
mm hmm


my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes
but it's really not very clear because you got single curve and double curve and d i dunno what that means one side is curved and then the other side is curved

mm hmm
no i think that's alright

mm hmm

hmm
feels like play dough
i'm gonna say yes
i imagine they're somewhere on the front we have a little case that you slip 'em in


'kay
five

five


it's four if you wanna do that
it adds to sixteen so that's four
oh i thought she said five
six

huh
wait a minute i thought it was the other way round too
sh
yeah i i was thinking one means no points you know all the way up to the top
i'll just i'll just reverse them all it's no problem
i thought you guys hated it
okay
say two
two
one
uh two
yeah i put it down as one point four for some reason
mine has all kinds of problems
uh three
wait why did i put three
i meant one on mine too
three point one i have four
three
one
two
three
two

mm hmm
i think the wheel would probably be mm

i think the base would definitely be larger 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold they're kinda smallish
yeah

well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable
mm



not that i can think of rhubarb

so it's just colour and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry


we could make it that shape but just have different colours and call 'em the different fruits we went with shape because we were having fun with the play dough
mm hmm


that everyone gave that a one or a two
yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote
no i imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door yeah um like on a normal remote
so it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the i r 's right there but it'd be on one of the sides probably
yeah i'd agree with changing the shape um i was just having fun making strawberries and stuff

it might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape
i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too

sure
sponginess

i think it was good we knew what we were doing it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute
well you told us when to start and when to end and that's all that matters



well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft powerpoint or any of this stuff no no i never touch macs either i just use the unix or the off market sort of wordperfect and all these other things
yeah well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it so i have all these documents i can't use now
but yeah i mean i guess it's okay

yeah i never use it
yeah my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works
yeah it probably does
yeah

yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control as if you'd wanted to

well i think it's interesting how it all went together like i had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap and you have how people want it to be spongy and
it seems planned you know

yeah if i hadn't been told that fruit was
they're pretty cool they're kinda hard to write with though

they're nicer than the pen that i'm using because like your stuff actually shows up here rather than having to look at the screen and write
but even so i dunno


oh yeah
well they drop off if you like move too much
but i don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones maybe we are i don't know
well the thing is like i actually worked in a company and i had a role and i had to go to meetings and like
the last thing i would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause i missed a meeting like usually i missed meetings deliberately
there's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company
it's mostly like rehashing old stuff and you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already
know it's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through
it seems like way overkill like if i missed a meeting i could probably get it summed up in like one sentence i wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and





i think i've learned not to bring play dough to meetings
it's hard enough to get people actually paying attention especially if you have food
all of us
you could change the vegetable or fruit
yeah
it's been a l
it's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand holdable and that the
user can use it you know it's not too big uh but we think that this
you know this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow and
i guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually would be
the um thing the locator how how so
okay so that's just
so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the
yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed
yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset
you could have a broccoli or you could have a mango
so tada
mm
yeah is it possible that we can bring this up on our own

is it meeting three minutes no it's not minutes
okay
okay cool
true's one and false is seven
so it's actually a scale
okay
does it feel fancy no
yeah okay

one
hmm
um three
yeah
so it's a one was true and seven was false
okay so you guys really didn't like it
i was like why did you guys design it that way if you hated it yeah
one
uh three
one
uh two

uh one
yeah uh one
uh one
one
one
two
one
which one is that again sorry three point one
i think
what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat and like then it you could hold it in your hand better
yeah the flat one yeah
yeah
i didn't yeah but like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat
but it's still too big i think in your hand yeah
yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection like you could probably do a strawberry still i think the broccoli would be out
you could do although the broccoli is quite comfortable i have to say like sorta like a joystick
i don't know so
uh
rhubarb these obscure fruits
i think we needn't
huh oh okay
yeah that could work
yeah
yeah i dunno

yeah 'cause yeah no one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously
or like i dunno some of 'em you can kind of think see as like
like you could if it was only this you know if it was shaped like that and it just had that but you see the problem is you have to attach that and this has to be detachable
so like maybe that's just too big because
yeah it's sorta like a joystick
i dunno i guess
yeah
dif
yeah yeah like uh we could do i'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped
yeah
mm
yeah yeah
alright
we could tr i don't know
cool well
yeah the broccoli i guess wins
we were a bit off task um so uh i can't think of any
so we'll have to like

mm
yeah i dunno
you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes but then that kind of re designs the whole project like but you could do like
yeah that's true yeah
yeah that's true
mm
hmm
i did
the prototype making was very creatively stimulating and i think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria
i think you were fine you did a good job leading

yeah i think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much as we just would be like i don't know all had ideas about it but yeah
no
hmm
i felt like my i dunno if it was just my role but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me
was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had but there's kinda it was kinda like okay i don't really think
i dunno what i'm doing here so i didn't really think it was helpful so i kind of just made up
my own stuff and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations
so i kind of wrote a lot of notes instead but yeah i d i don't really like powerpoint personally think it's
kinda stupid
yeah but uh
yeah it didn't really yeah

so like a f
yeah i think so
yeah i mean it
yeah i kinda thought that um i felt like i would go and like try to use my information or like i'd make this stupid little
presentation and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because i dunno i felt like
i was off task all the time but um
yeah
i wanna s
i i'd like to see what what it looks like on the
yeah i think i'd like to um
i dunno
like it was the i think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down but like they're kinda clumsy i guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like
yeah i dunno but they're they're okay
uh i think and i think that uh
all this technology like i guess some people must be interested in using it but i can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes or like i dunno
hm
i guess it would be
it's gotta be worth it to i 'cause i'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful 'cause
can't really imagine dunno
how about a p a
um i dunno
yeah

m meeting adjourned

i think it would be a good idea i like it



um evaluation criteria i've got a presentation
so i need where's the cable
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole
this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start
um
right
this doesn't okay um the method is we well i've analysed the user requirements and
integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy
marketing and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain
way feel in a certain way and this is everything's listed down
um look in a certain way feel in a certain way it has to be technologically innovative
and it has to be easy to use these are all things we looked at at the start um and criteria that have to
be met we have to use a table i'll show you that later together to decide whether
it meets the standards and we we have therefore in total
um
we have five we have eleven points according to which this
should be evaluated and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation
criteria i would like to show you the table we have to use um
no this is the table can you see this here
um so the que the questions i've given you c could you write that down true is one
and and false is seven and we'll just go through each
point together hopefully um
i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow i dunno how it works exactly i haven't been told
yeah it's in the um
it's in the project documents
it's called evaluation criteria
and it's
under evaluation
yeah
you've found it all
so it was um
yeah true's one
do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly

yeah okay
um
yes it's if it's fancy you put one if it's really unfancy it's seven
yeah something

they shouldn't really be questions should be more like
are the batteries easy to insert
yes very very true okay
okay
apparently i'm supposed to use the whiteboard do we um is it necessary
we'll just do um

yeah okay
i don't feel any right um
right so one point one we'll just go in a circle
right ooh i don't know right one
five two okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four is that what the company does
yeah
oh no it adds to thirteen one five five two
one five five two is thirteen over four for now i think that's um next
really two uh oh
right one point three is
yeah
i really
well uh
yeah yeah it was one is true and false is seven i should've kept the table up
right well i'm glad this came out
yeah no oh that's quite funny
okay
okay so starting again one point one
two okay one point two
two okay um one point three
ha two point one
yeah oh dear okay sorry
two and one sorry about that t two point two which is one point five
okay
three point one is that correct on my slide yeah
one four three three three point two
three point three
four point one
two four point two
two and four point three
one two
right so i put one on that okay i'll um i'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue or is it tedious i'm i'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone
i didn't know how else to do it
okay well the worst ones were three point one
do does every ones have the slide three point one
slide show
material technologically innovative okay um do you want to change it what are the suggestions i don't know anyone
yeah that it's three point one was not that good four point one
the shape four point two


yeah that looked really good
are there any fruits that look like broccoli no
i think that broccoli is my favourite actually uh despite the
yeah
yeah and just have the colour match or something

mm

yeah
yeah
yeah
um
think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one
batteries easy to insert for some reason which can be easily i think that's not a problem any more
no
i think everyone's under three anyway
so i think it's yeah those are the only two points

yeah

do you want this and we can all
no
it's alright yeah
yeah



yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well


which isn't very user friendly though
i though it was brilliant no
no mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful i think i think it depends on the role no

yeah but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um
a whole system 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the
yeah yeah
no
but i think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing
yeah like if everyone's given the same input i don't have a clue anyway um what's next looks like oh no that's not um
it's quite
yeah
yeah it's all very new no
it's all very new
sorry

what what's the end are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report or we ending is that the end

end of meeting you have to tell her she
okay we have to fill in all this stuff stuff stuff stuff
yeah
well there's al eight nine ooh
oh ooh
hi everyone hope you had a nice lunch um alright we're moving on to conceptual design

um i'll just review what we did in our last meeting um under marketing we targeted our audience and
um yeah
that was generally how helpful that was um
then we considered some design options with how it should look um we discussed
an ipod like button system which uh we haven't concluded but we're
right um
so if you all have presentations to do we can see what where you've come from our last time
does everyone have presentations
okay would anybody like to go first
okay
and why not wood and why not wood
's good
hmm


mm


i think it's the next it's the blue one yeah


yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control

oh we s hadn't discussed it last time
you need a screen for it
we're um we're actually not having d v d  that was one of th i i was sorry i i meant to update you on that um
yeah
yeah
you've yeah i know what you're saying you have to
but but imagine someone with s
but i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
i mean with that many options you'd uh i'd think that the screen would be better because you could have that menu option sort of
yeah
yeah
uh
mm
mm
yeah so the t v  is the screen that yeah
so it would have all these different options of changing
to
okay
yeah
yeah
um right
what if i mean if you're thinking of the design of it now like the a you know physical attributes
um and you just have this it's like just a long silver thing or whatever
we're thinking i mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing or
yeah
so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before i mean okay
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i've seen some people just going like that with their thumb yeah
yeah
but were there buttons on there as well
mm yeah
yeah
what if um you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much
like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that so the options
are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it
do do you know what i'm talking about though like uh yeah just something
yeah that you can flip over yeah yeah
yeah i mean i guess that's the thing is is if w i if we can do this that'd probably be
yeah yeah
so i guess we have to look into the um like the programming how this how they actually programme these things and if that's yeah
i mean it would y would that would be

huh

yeah okay
yeah you don't know they mean yeah it's like yeah
mm and it is technologically innovative in a way so that fits with the
b
yeah
oh god

ah yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean definitely the area round it
yeah
an orange

yeah
yeah yeah

so what if what this is i'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking
if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand so like what you're
feeling is comfortable and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is and on that
hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there
is that kind of i 'cause i i'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours um

i mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the
a ball


yeah
this is just
okay say that's the s say that's the squashy bit squashy
that see i was thinking this s sorry i was thinking this bit here would be
the cover and like that's your actual thing and like this you could have like you could
have like cherries and things around there um but
i was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy
it's almost like your thumb is farther up so if if you could squish it lower then
yeah i know what you meant yeah


yeah
mm
okay
yeah okay
hmm
well that's not very neat but
mm hmm
yeah

yeah

it was yeah silver and yellow it l it looks like i don't
yeah
i mean that's another question where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it
yeah
yeah th and that would that
mm hmm

i don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me
but if someone components concept question mark energy question mark
was that you okay oh right right yeah um so what d but what do we know about
energy i mean we're gonna use batteries right and


i think batteries sound good what does everyone else think
what about kryptonite
yeah
what does chip on print mean
uh huh
okay
right
so chip on print is just means like that they're mass produced okay and case uh i guess that's what we've been talking about yeah casing yeah
thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see
is there anything else we need to
talk about oh when we move on you two are going to be playing with play dough
um and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design and you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation
so you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach
mm
see you soon
does it matter that i end early
how how early is it
i didn't get a pop up thing that said

hmm
yes
sure
so i've been looking at the components design um mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting
um so we need some custom design parts and other parts we'll just use standard um i assume we'll be custom designing our case probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the remote and the locator
and we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time but once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out
um standard parts include the buttons and the wheels um the ipod style wheel the infrared l e d 
is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it um we need a radio sender and receiver those are standard
and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote
so we have some material options um we can use rubber plastic wood or titanium um
i'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy um and the rubber
case requires rubber buttons so if we definitely want plastic buttons we shouldn't have a rubber case
and hmm
uh well we can use wood i don't know why we'd want to um and also we should note that if we want an ipod style
wheel button it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip we can't use the minimal chip we need the next higher
grade which is called regular i don't think it's much more expensive but it is more expensive
so that's what i've got on design









you need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song like you know that band or whatever with t v  channels it's you know one two three so
yeah

yeah
yeah
my flatmates actually had one with a wheel and it it did show up on the t v 

they have to r wheel really fast but i think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels at least on theirs
it's more expensive according to the design people you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in which is more expensive than the regular chip which is more expensive than the minimal
mm hmm



yeah

w when we had the wheely remote control we it was on the top i think if you held it like that
yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that i don't know what they do so we just used the top part
yeah yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of
yeah
oh how they make the menu show up on the t v 
i don't know i believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t v  not inside the remote
i'm not sure

well they usually are well
i guess that's right it always comes with the t v 
yeah it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something 'cause it just doesn't come up every day or something
mm hmm

yeah

or on the t v  too


oh i was gonna say you said uh people want spongy um one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things so that would be spongy



yeah i think it could work
don't think i'd want it to feel like a banana

you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit apple machine and they have like the blueberry like all the colours are named after fruits








oh mm


i was thinking sort of a single ball shape so you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a
mm hmm
yeah i guess so




yeah you could squish it
i guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath


i think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case
especially if you're switching out the squishy part then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off
well i dunno you'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again


that was me
yes
uh we actually had an option of batteries solar power and um a dynamo which is something i don't know what it is something to do with torches
oh okay yeah the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself
so i sort of picked battery we could have talked about doing a wind up or a dynamo or a
solar power um but i think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways
it it seems a little weird for a living room anyways
didn't have enough data to actually
all it said was it gave sort of relative some chips are more expensive than others sort of things it didn't give me any actual cost
most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk so i don't think it's that much of a problem
like the chip is probably the most expensive part
um for things like remote controls um they stamp out a chip calculators too i think um so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap but it's not like a computer you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls it's like stamped onto the chip
yeah
case is what we were discussing yeah



'scuse me
yes
yeah



mm hmm
so
oh uh there we go uh
okay um well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh i actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh
so so okay let me get this right okay uh
okay alright anyway um here we go conceptual user interface trying we're gonna try to talk about
um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this
ipod ish remote control based on fruit vegetable design and um basically
so this is a touched ba a touch based graphical interface system uh so
people are going to be looking at this little screen um kind of i mean i assume are we still on the screen idea
'cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel
you it seems like you would need a screen
but like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay so b you you're gonna have to switch to like d v d  and like other things like that aren't you are we
okay alright okay
okay okay so anyway if well we just we need to okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think
i was thinking okay so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then and you're
just gonna i mean i think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right yeah like you're g
yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that i guess but like choose channel control
like if you wa because people aren't gonna be able to have like um you know channels one two three four five
six seven eight nine so that people seems to be well
you know but you're gonna have to scroll to get channels so um i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because
so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just i guess
i c i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t v  like what channel you're on you can just scroll
and you can just get to like five or like twelve or
i oh yeah
'cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can
yeah
yeah if you do it w so it would have to be you i mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of you know range we need to have on the wheel and um
so you're either you're you know th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that you know you can like tap for um different
uh whatchamacallits different um you know functions like volume or like you can tap just to get to different channels
like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth
and then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the
brightness of your television or if you want to um you know switch around
i don't know like these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that like
i would think so too like
so i mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it you know because but then
again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that like is just there and you're not really
using it that's kind of m yeah
yeah that's the only thing though
yeah so then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing um
you can get to you know you can
like maybe it'll be that central button that like then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t v  and you can just scroll around like to do the timer to do the yeah yeah
yeah but the remote itself isn't really cluttered up
hmm yeah well we don't want the screen i guess but um
'cause that just it does seem like it that would be like incredibly expensive but i dunno and then so
it just im really all you need is like this little wheel then and you can control everything
so
yeah
it doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow i mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the t v 
yeah yeah definitely like i think we're looking at something that could be like
like even maybe like a cir i'm f i'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing i mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your
i mean how do how do i'm not really
like when i use an ipod i end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it so
yeah or your thumb or something so
yeah yeah so
mm yeah
yeah so but i mean i think it could be pretty small like i d i mean you you want it to be large enough that
you can
but can't you just get
k
yeah but i mean do you need that if if you can get to you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the t v  screen that keeps it
really
yeah uh you wouldn't i don't i just don't think you would even need it so
mean
i mean you can do it you it's it doesn't seem that hard
i mean i've never bought a remote it sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television which is a little
my i've never bought just a remote like so i don't i don't really know but um
so um but i mean it's i've never had a hard time with like my remotes like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever you know and i don't think that should uh that should be too hard
yeah
yeah well so
so do we need i dunno well i guess we have to you know think about but i mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up that's what it does anyway
yeah
yeah
so but oh you mean if we have this screen like the ipod screen on the telly okay yeah so
yeah i think i mean i think i think the touch based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you
know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now i hit this you know you have your little guide out and you're like hit this
button twice like to activate the date
yeah i guess and it is trendy the ipods are really hot right now so
um yeah by web research yeah so
oh
yeah
oh okay that would be cool mm
yeah c that's e that would be kind of oh you know usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type you know thing but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like
or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know we c tapped into that so like it feels like
a vegetable
yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah you could name it after fruits and vegetables or
yeah
so i think yeah colours
yeah
yeah
yeah unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables i do i dunno um
that's in the shape of a fruit like a
yeah oh i like that shape
yeah
yeah
it's like it has to be s yeah
yeah
what if yeah what if the squishy oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable and you can so so maybe
one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing and then you could have like the banana squishy
thing and you could get you could have your choice you know
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah oh
yeah
yeah i mean i think uh and i think the handhe i think the handheld part is definitely
so you could make that
into the fruit and vegetable part
yeah so where are the fruit and vegetables now
fruits and veg
yeah
yeah
we could promote the banana one like mm
mm
oh yeah
yeah
yeah i think um
it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit
the part that you yeah can change into the different you know trendy vegetables and fruits but uh it
yeah

yeah

the dynamo would be interesting
oh
hmm
hmm
cool
bless you

yeah
um can i do next 'cause i have to say something about the material
which is quite shocking
ha mm
right um i have been searching the current trends um both on the web
and via fashion watchers and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is
a fashion uh fancy look and feel um next comes technologic
technology and the innovations to do with that and th last thing is the
easy to use um factor um fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality
of the thing but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use um
our fashion watchers in milan and paris have decided well
noticed that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the
is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want you know
wh whatever our motto is um
for fashion we go for fashion the fashion in electronics so we want to put the fashion electronics we need to go
fruit and vegetables and also go for a spongy feel so the
the question of our technology whate is industrial designer
as to the material should be limited to i don't know how spongy it can be should discuss this together
i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go
um i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer
fruits to vegetables but that's just a personal opinion i think i think people like to
have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room uh those are just suggestions and also
we need to decide whether this should be printed so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff
or should the actual remote look like a fruit
um and finally again with the spongy it has to be technologically innovative
so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with
a solution that's better than mine um yeah to summarise these are the points that need to be
um touched in order to get a good decision and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter thank you for your attention

neither was i well it's a trend in fashion in clothing and um fabrics

but the screen can come up on the telly the she said that correct
graphical interface uh on the you can have it on the telly though
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
look it even has settings
on the you can just take theirs and just
yeah but should be comfortable
yeah i use it like that
yeah
uh
well you can have it on the settings no
they already do it

no
but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out because the problem with buttons is you like they
have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand and
i never get it never ever so
well on the telly
mm
did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web
that's quite interesting
what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i'm dreading
yeah
yeah yeah
just nice feel but i hate spongy


well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover
if it's a small thing you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana which
frankly i'm not particularly fond of um you could just have covers and then your mobile f
it's like a mobile phone thing you know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
and it could the colour can fit your sitting room so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry and then if you have a green one you can have well i don't know um
yeah
maybe a ball
know a squashy ball a relaxing squashy ball
that you can p well i see you're thinking it's weird you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the
hard bit and i'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um
sticker sort of because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit like a
oh okay yeah
yeah i was thinking of getting a cover for
which is cheaper well i don't know if it's cheaper actually
yeah so it wouldn't be very big in either like how big this big and then you just do that i suppose

well just a li i can't des like condom thingy like a a cover
but well the question is which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant
department for that and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that and for now we can do two
prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is and
no
um that's nicer i think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater
um

if it's a bit like those juggling balls you can change shape according to your
to the way you hold it if it's got sand in it maybe or something you it it just moulds to your hand
we we don't know
yeah
and the rest is the company the company colour's silver
okay
mm hmm should also fit the batteries which we haven't
okay
mm hmm
no but it does it automatically does it automatically i don't know
okay
oh a dynamo is ah it's a bicycle it's a bicycle mechanism it's the en it's like if if something moves when it moves it stores energy
it's quite sweet
no but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is the moment you move it it c it creates energy on its own
which is quite cool so if you throw it it's gonna store loads of energy and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f i find them annoying but we need to find cost
don't know the cost
does anyone have costs on the on the web
okay
right
mm

oh thank you
i it's strange because
welcome back welcome back everybody
so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting
and uh
opening and uh p m s of the meet minutes uh prototype presentation from uh christine and uh agnes
yes and uh evaluation criteria
the finance it's uh from my side from the management and uh production evaluation
then uh closing so we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise
and close the product and project and to move further okay so
okay let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype
so i handle to
so shall i go to sorry
yep
s
okay let's go to a m i 
so in two or three or
yeah
yes
mm hmm
i think the microphone is on on the top uh on the middle the under the flip
so that will be the safe so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to
yes
uh it's it's
yeah but uh uh my opinion i think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to
uh the talk okay so then you can speak then you can close it but if you put it on the on the flip okay then
uh technical i don't think it's uh feasible 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised
yeah the sides maybe is good so that's good idea
yes so it's maybe good idea
yes
yeah
so it's maybe good idea
s s
okay s
i'm fine i'm satisfi i'm satisfied
of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy but i think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight
yes
yep
that's your uh prototype model okay that's good thank you very much so any comments or uh
okay
yes that uh
so i'll come back to the

so evaluation criteria i think uh that will be good so then let's come to the finance uh i have some uh calculations which i made uh as for uh the budget
so here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells
uh it's optional somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print that's what uh we were talking about that
so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker then uh we have the wood material then special colour and push button
so it's uh actually our budget was uh twelve point five euro but uh it's coming to nine point nine five euro so we are under uh below the budget okay so still we are saving some money
i think it's a good figure

than thank you

so maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing for the sales okay and uh
it's not yeah yeah
yeah yeah

yes so still uh we have twelve point five euro
yes

yeah but
yes yep
yes this we are talking about one unit okay so when it go into the quantity okay and the cost will come down
yeah
yep
yeah

but anyhow still we are under control okay so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors okay to get
uh the production cost less okay so then we can save some money okay
to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions whatever okay so that
uh i will look after i will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down
yes
you're in four
trendwatch

okay
yep
mm hmm
yes
mm hmm
yep
yes
yep
of course
yep
yep
yes
yes
to the agents
yes
or ebay or
yes
yeah that's a good idea
to impro more profit and uh
yeah yes
yeah
we can
i don't think that's uh not possible it's uh okay then l uh let's wait for the production okay then uh you can evaluate the product so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real
t
oh but
yes it's it's very quick of course it will uh come back in two weeks okay it will be ready in two weeks for evaluation okay
yes the prototype uh prototype product evaluation
yes
yes yes
yeah
so you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks
yeah
yeah because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory okay so we can give it a product evalua yes yes
so we'll do it in the other place and i don't think it's take more than four weeks time
or uh
okay so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation okay then uh
it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team okay
uh from the management then we can launch in the market
hm
s any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss
okay so then uh
okay uh let's take like this let's proceed with this model okay for the for the marketing direction okay so no more changes will be made okay in this the basic design
okay so we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then we can uh go for the
second generation
okay there's no end there's not limit every every custom
okay
well every customer okay they have their own ideas they have their own test okay so there's no end there's no limit
yeah so that's the reason you are here for uh the design okay i hope you made a good design
yeah but uh see we ought to take a few considerations okay one is the price consideration one is future consideration okay
like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi i can eat more chilli okay so i it's a depends on the
individual taste you know so we have we have to balance somewhere
yes
yeah
the sports time
football
football
yes
yes
yes
research
yep
yes
yes the that of course uh i will convince the management to do that okay
sure sure yes
yeah
that's the reason ed is here i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value yes
we are behind the scene and he is the front screen so
he's on the big screen
okay so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget
and uh is the product evaluated okay so that will uh come soon okay for uh
but our time being so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design
and uh let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is
over and the meantime let's celebrate so let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party
's good
thank you thank you again for all
and see you in the evening for drinks
i'm sorry to be late
agnes yes
uh thank you so you did a powerpoint presentation good for you



um and uh i could
yeah the d
we haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed that depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um
yes okay
uh huh
no i mean it depends on the design of the circuit board
maybe i've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i'm holding my cup of coca cola in the other hand
mm hmm
yeah y better you pass it around with a napkin
it's um
it's um
you need to work on the weight a little bit
we're glad you're satisfied
mm hmm

yes great i i'm surprised congratulations
oh okay it's gonna cost a long way to c you know cost a lot of money to market it is it
thirty
yeah
so that means we can put the uh
the l c d  in yeah
although customisation because this is being done you know the on on order basis
it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right would be in
producing quantity but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the
uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one euro that's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow that's really outstanding

is this the same one you did before
okay

yeah no kidding
mayb maybe they already expected something
could could i go to findings uh uh um i would
uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um
delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet
for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the p product to the customer's residence
that way you have no storage you have no um you do have transportation still have the labour cost
but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale the point of sale is
online
right like amazon in fact we should sell through amazon don't you think or ebay yeah
there's an idea going with um
ah we we're do you know selling a unique product uh
mm
mm
mm hmm
and you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight
mm
we're getting used to that it's not quite like trying on a shoe but
people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying
uh huh
great
works for me

prototypes you mean in um
we probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test market it

any outstanding
no i'm go ahead
did you have something

second generation




our project doesn't um
ed d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t v  remote control sales
would it be the christmas season by any chance sports season
which sport season
so so
maybe what
so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user tested
device with some special event and and then um so that gives us a little more time
perhaps then we anticipated because i don't know when the world cup is but i'm sure there's gonna be one
or another m major sports event probably not the um the football games coming up the end of january
i think that might be a little too aggressive um but so i'm just ig uh pointing out
a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri
and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to
uh also
and to work with motion pictures there might be some motion pictures that are coming out um
that are coming out on d v d  that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it
so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with sony pictures for example maybe some
management has got uh relationships there we can leverage
that's great
disposable diapers is an example of that in fact yes it is one of the first consumer
products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product and
uh people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away
'cause it wasn't uh but then when they re launched them thirty years later they were virtually the same design but
people had gotten the throw away you know paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um
so you're right timing is very important but i think we've got a good product
that's right
it's gonna be very important to the company
good luck ed
you look very relaxed considering h you know the uh the weight on your shoulders yeah

sounds good thank you nice working with you


yeah
thanks
mm okay
i've done a presentation but it pretty much covers work that we've both done so if i'm missing anything christine can just correct me

it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world but
three
um
no it's think it's the last one
no then this is the la yeah that one final design it is named appropriately you just couldn't see the name um okay can i have the mouse
thanks
alright so
from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape the material that we chose was wood and uh the colour would be customisable 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour
um so in terms of function you have to be able to turn the t v  on and off volume and channel control
menu control voice recognition control and we've incorporated the l c d  screen on the flip panel as part of
the design if we figure out it's too expensive well then you just take it off um so
to unveil our lovely product
this is our remote control with the flip panel as you can see
so if you lift up the panel you can see the lovely yellow l c d  display um this is actually hard to do the yellow button you have is the on off button so it's really big hard to miss
you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume so up volume up down volume down the green are the channel changing
s and it's one of those very light very touchable displays
and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom and on the
right hand side you have the access to the menu on the t v  and on the left hand side
you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition so this is pretty
much what we had on the white board the last time
so
oh yes additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front so that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control
yeah
but it shouldn't be under the flip either because you can have the remote control closed but you still might want to activate it by voice
but if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice why use the voice why not just use your hand i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up i can just use my voice
yeah and you don't wanna let go of either one

i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip it can be on the side somewhere
yeah
so i mean i can pass this around if anyone wants to


yeah
yeah exactly

yes and maybe the shape of the buttons the little egg shapes aren't the most economical but
yeah i mean this is plasticene there's only so much you can do we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well
but
and part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light because they don't feel like they have enough control over it so i mean maybe this is excessively heavy but i think it needs to have some weight it needs to feel like you're still holding something
so that's pretty much it for our presentation actually
yeah

no we do but it's not filled in it's number thirty oh yeah yeah you're right sorry yes
um hmm
yes

that's no i think it's the same one
functional
it looks like it there's
s yeah
um hmm
mm
i was thinking the same thing yeah
directly
um hmm
yeah
yeah you can do a shipping centre somewhere or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs
yeah
that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have
see maybe what other people have done what the range of possibility as whereas if you're in a store
you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person you may not really know what it is you want whereas
on the web if you have a bunch of pictures it can sort of trigger ideas and
yeah
the weight and feel
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yes
mm hmm
what turnaround time do we have
'cause i mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long
yeah
mm hmm
think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task
no no we definitely shouldn't do it in our factory
what ab
well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad this is bad we want this done differently

the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of
no but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up
yes but i'm not everybody i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need we have our own motivations in mind we have our own ideas in mind but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell
yeah of course i'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally but in the project we have no redesign time and
yeah

yeah that's a good idea
yeah
mm hmm
that's actually good place to advertise it too
yeah
mm hmm
it's just something to to keep in mind 'cause it's really really important a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user tested and completely flopped when in fact it gets re released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy
really that i didn't know
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yep
exactly


okay
thanks
bye

probably
technical pa i would think
ha


i don't wanna say louder yeah
can also be on the side
no because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything and it'd be accessible all the time to voice
yeah
compliments to the artist
uh

well the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh

well we haven't come to mine yet so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion yes

well it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr
provisionary cost analysis we do not have a l c  display l c  display is gonna be very expensive it's gonna be
it's not it doesn't say we don't have the price up there okay so if we add approximately two to three euro per
remote now we're up around about twelve twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested um
display in but as far as production um i'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also and in mine you'll see uh

the problem with uh our survey the p the possibility that how many units can be sold what percentage of the market etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration
uh this is just production cost it is not uh advertising cost it's not transportation cost uh
and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit we're gonna have to go a long ways
yes
slightly
it's gonna be very hard to reduce
that's not bad
if we can go to to my display
and we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market
so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project
if i'm still here yep
the four gives me it's gotta be uh trendwatch
no
it shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one no no we g no that's the same one you have to go back and find another one
whatever name it popped up under
uh functional try functional it might not be it either but we'll see
yep that's it so we'll go screen by screen although since uh we need to have some type of idea
on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units
per year okay our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which
is approximately the same as the independent study
so if we continue we'll look at the findings next screen
which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year which is actually a tremendous amount
no kidding yeah
so if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that cannot exceed
twenty five euro okay we're already in that that price okay with transport promotion labour
because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost transport for the material to the stores or whatever
how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers
twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units at two million units we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit okay
so obviously we w w i just did a run down the evaluation of the form the fan uh the fancy stylishness
of the of the unit the ease of use speech recognition cost we've gone through these now the company must
evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production
or we project this over two years but being that the market changes very very quickly maybe there's no more interest in buying
this thing in eighteen months from now so now we have to come up with a decision can the company sell two million
units can it sell it for fifty euros

s upscale technology well
there are several companies that have gone that way
weight the feel of the product but
there are several that have gone through with the watches too you can customise a watch you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production you can change it uh
there's a lot of online that's that is doing this now
and when you're rotating you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year which could you know feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit
well obviously
mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea to see get get their
i think we pretty much covered everything
well then it may not be
like people don't like wood
very specific
hmm
right before the eur the world cup world soccer world cup soccer they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control

or any major sports
yeah i'm the one who takes the heat if it's a flop it's the marketer
yes yes stress
celebration

very good
thank you very much bye bye yep okay see you later on
hello hello
you have to put it exactly on the on the yeah
i took your mouse yeah just yeah no that's for me i just have to make some notes i got my uh mouse
yeah

uh actually my laptop doesn't work switch it on again
oh no
so you all read what we are going to do or not okay
yeah that's right
i just made a a simple uh presentation
so you put some things in it
okay
how does this work i dunno
this one
ah cool okay so that's my name uh we're going to make uh a remote control you already know that just have a look are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting you know this is about twenty five minutes this meeting
so um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do you also read what this the things
or not yet okay so um yeah it has to be original trendy user friendly
that's what we're going to design uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the
remote control fir the first thing is th the functional design that's very important we
have to look what the needs are the effects of the functional design and and how the mm the
the remote control works so that's where we're going to look in the functional design it's for the f next meeting
the the second thing is the conceptual design that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the
components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface and we have to
look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market
and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah you know
what it is it's exactly how it looks and whatever okay so uh no this
is a these are two smartboards with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map folder okay
so no okay have a look at that one
okay
so uh what we're going to do first is um
so you can read you have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and
um and say why it's your favourite animal so and you have this
is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the
pen
so okay so first have to show you maybe you can come here to have a look how it works
yes okay this a new page it's okay use pen format
and a different colour can use here no i just take the pink
you take oh there's no pink okay oh just purple okay no blue
and uh line width ten okay uh just take
what i'm going to draw is an elephant
just draw slowly because otherwise it won't work
it's a very
nice elephant you can see
i dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter
i just h
something like this oh no
yeah okay because i like uh okay
just takes so long okay whatever just
you erased this one
it's a bit slow you can see this is a bit annoying
okay so just
for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want
just don't um yeah just u use it like that yeah that's okay

it's in format
yeah
just
no it has to be an animal so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something okay okay okay okay

okay cool
hmm yeah that's nice
uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter just it's to get used to the whiteboard but it's okay just make a new blank new blank page
yeah not too far to the to the t pen top
maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back so that no to the yeah
no it's a dog
uh we d only have twenty five minutes so

use your fantasy
just hold it more more to the back then you don't have okay
no that's okay thank you
i thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to word you already did it or no no not yet okay but it's just
sorry
yeah i know but i d i i thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in word so that's not just it's just a picture so it's not that cool as i th thought it would be
no

i don't know what time did we start this meeting i'm not sure
half past
okay
okay perfect
yeah thank you now we just have to save everything so
oh this is definitely the best one
okay so
uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five euros
okay that's and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros so we have to uh use a big market in europe
the production cost are about half the price of selling price sorry
so can someone make a
a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million i dunno uh so
we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control
the and everything so just have a look how it we think about remote controls
oh yeah that's a good question
i think it's i'm not i'm not sure it's not mm i think
i don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five euros so not sure but
okay so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control okay perfect
yeah everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control
no just everything
so yeah what what what's a remote control it's just a black thing with some buttons on it it's not nothing very special but um yeah that's right
so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user
hmm yeah
that's right should be a good point
just big enough for the buttons we have that's that's it
but you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open okay yeah that's cool maybe for the d v d  pla player or something if you just okay
yeah
why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control there are buttons on it
okay
but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it

yeah
yeah so and if you have a touch screen in it it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile
no
you can put games on your remote control whatever
oh maybe that's a good idea just to put it on your television and just s recharge you never have to use any batteries
yeah how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger
i dunno

uh if you th look at the market it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it because maybe it's too expensive
yeah that's right yeah
the option just the option that's cool
yeah
has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or
yeah
yeah
yeah just for the t v  and just the normal function that's fine
but maybe it's
maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called
maybe it's hard t
no that's right so maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square just normal remote control
just think about it we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting so there's some more things we have uh another thirty minutes so then we're going to meet again so you know what you have to what you have to do
yeah
yeah i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t v  a d v d  player all that things also from a user but all these things together yeah everything
yeah no maybe not not uh that's not a f that's something for for for yeah that's not for you
just if what's in the market what's normal uh what kind of uh buttons do you have
yeah it's alright
yeah just is that okay
okay
so see you in thirty minutes
for the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square so your laptop

no sorry
two
good morning
mouse
come on there we are

let's just check one more time
mm
yeah
one uh most to the right yes that one yes
yes
yeah
purple

looks very nice

a pink elephant
the water is important


yeah
yeah like this
okay um
let's make it
um
a dog
ooh

ah okay
a pig
i can make a dog
um
'kay i make a cat of it
oh not too quick
no i have it
i just draw too quick i think
okay that's it
more
it's just to get used to it
yeah that's right it but you actually got to write on the paper you really got to write on that paper
yeah but it's just a picture
you really
no
it's a donkey
uh i think it was uh
yeah

piece of cake
uh easy
universal and only television or more devices
ah okay
not just a t v 
okay
well we can try to make it special
well

yeah nothing
n

it shouldn't be too big but i don't think we can make it too small 'cause it has to have a lot of functions so
we can't make it smaller than the things we see now i think
yeah or we have to make something uh
like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer
maybe more trendy
fold open where you can see uh more options i think
yeah something uh on top just dren general things like volume and t v  channels and inside things you don't use that often
yeah b i wanted
no you can make an uh manual in it
but that's yeah i think it's much uh too expensive
yeah too fragile
yeah
yeah
maybe that's a good idea but yeah we have to look at the price now i think
well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger
maybe have uh
yeah 'cause well
yeah
maybe uh use it as a separate option sell it uh separately
rechargeable
yeah
yeah
well i think we have to look at that 'cause well you can do the standard way but then you won't
well you can um
have uh the basic things on the same place like on off button on top and the
t v  channels one two three four as a block and then the volume uh obviously on t on top
so you can see but the rest is uh you don't use that often so if you have a clear button
with an good icon on it it should be clear as well so it doesn't matter what place it is
on the remote control i think so you can do something unique with that
yeah yeah
yeah that's what i meant
uh
okay but yeah
no what you want to do with it
yeah i also wrote down some stuff that you want on a
technical fun fu
what do you want to do with your remote control what do you need on your remote control i already wrote some down some ideas
yep
there's already a document in the
folder about it
okay
i will
it didn't say that
your fault

bye bye
good morning
okay
good morning
should i bring my uh pen too or
okay
i do
my laptop is crashing
cr
help help help
test test yes it's working
i think my laptop is a bit
etchy
uh p



okay

wow

wow



take it easy
i i was gonna make a cat too
okay

nice eh

uh
excuse me
yeah it probably would be universal
hmm maybe i don't know
and uh also for the v c r  and uh d v d  player and okay
yeah probably

okay
and how big should it be
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah n
yeah or you c
o or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control
uh maybe be uh it's it's
yeah or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small
uh like a a to have yeah maybe it would
kid proof
and uh how about the batteries uh should you put it in a recharger or a just
mm yeah
yeah i dunno
yeah if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive but i don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing
yeah
yeah
yeah but i have a mouse that's uh uh also uh
yeah and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station or you can change your batteries so
yeah
n uh if if we want to make it special we probably have to do a lot of testing if it really works
yeah
yeah
and what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um
maybe uh like when you fold it open when you have it closed you
can still uh do the th the functions yeah but n yeah but uh
i basically when i'm watching t v  i'm just using like five buttons or so
so
yeah
okay
okay
okay


hello
ah
plate
uh i also forgot my mouse but i don't need my mouse i think

damn computers

can you hear me hello test i dunno
check okay i think it works
mm hmm we're gonna make a remote control


press f  eleven

folder yes

ah i can see it now

it look like a dinosaurs

okay
let me try one
okay
mm okay and then uh what's the colour how do i do
ah
i'll take this one
uh there has to be water but
yeah yeah but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water so i first uh draw the water
uh okay and now
i make the animal
it's a fish
mm hmm
so
um
this is a worm

okay who next uh
okay
well paul

i think it's a pig
or a dog
a sheep




no
yeah yeah it's a real pen
oh
y you can you can't edit in the edit it in word
oh okay

half past ten
brilliant
yep




yeah my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control
because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television we sell it uh apart
so i
because

yeah i know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh euros
yeah i think
okay

well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television we don't have
uh the same television uh all the time so uh that's no matter um
if we uh control the v c r  and the d v d  player player with it
uh it has to be clear because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons
um
i think it must be a very good control so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality
no yeah i dunno um
yes
ah that's that's
ah right right
oh that's good yeah
yeah
yeah but
yeah but it's not reachable i think touch screen and we have to care for
uh the strength of the remote control because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house
that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken
yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh

um
ma maybe a home station
yeah
ah yeah


yeah but a home station is uh a really good idea because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is and now you can put it always at the same place maybe it's
therefore it's a good idea but maybe it's expensive
yeah
you can yeah you can buy it with it
oh yeah
uh i i set something on paper already size looks uh usable uh the buttons
on usable places uh the the on off button must be on top uh it has to
lay good in the hand you you have to uh
yeah i don't i don't know i don't know if we
you can make it very special to create our own um looks but it's very hard to
nah
yeah yeah what paul already said uh on on top are the the basic options on top and if you fold it open

mm if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control
okay
um for m for me uh the marketing expert the user requirements uh specification do i need to think as a user a as a a a only the looks and the
okay
yeah it's also about strength and uh for everything uh
okay
yep
okay
yeah me too
okay well done
oh paul
ciao

bye bye
hello
yeah yep
um i've got a powerpoint presentation
sure
it's not very long in any case
yep yeah
okay so what i was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had which you've already mentioned in
the agenda d um lawrence of arabia apocalypse now and amadeus were fairly historical serious dramatic
and also action ey movies except for maybe amadeus um this month i was thinking of selecting something
that's more in the present time still dramatic but slightly less serious
and what i'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery and i know that a lot of people find
mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days they kind of can predict what's gonna happen um but in the nineties there
were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay didn't see that coming so i thought we could
maybe show one of those and even if people have already seen the movie a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again
and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around or you see where the clues were and mm what led
up to the end so that's more along the lines of what i was thinking
and the two in particular that i would propose are
next slide please the usual suspects and the sixth sense um i don't know if you've seen any
of them uh the usual suspects was directed by bryan singer and written by
christopher mcquarrie it has a fairly large cast so i'm not gonna read all of them but the main characters
are kevin spacey and gabriel byrne and it's basically about five criminals who get set
up um they're arrested they're released from prison and the get together um
and plan a crime and basically the story is told through the views of one of the
suspects
um the tag line is kind of neat five criminals one lineup no coincidence and you get told the story
um as uh that these f characters are being controlled um by
one sort of uber villain and in the end you find who the uber villain was and i kind of like
the the quote from rolling stone magazine the usual suspects is the freshest funniest

well they ha have you guys seen the movie
so i'm not gonna give away you want me to give away the movie that'll spoil it
i'll tell you later but the the quote from rolling stone is fairly accurate
i think it's one of the freshest funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since pulp fiction
and the other movie is the sixth sense with the famous line i see dead people which the little boy says
um it was written and directed by m  night uh shyamalan and stars bruce willis haley joel osment
and toni collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end
yeah
yeah the sixth sense was very commercial but
anyways
it's the poster for the sixth sense but unfortunately i couldn't find a clear big enough one

yeah yeah i th i think it's only part of a full yeah it goes th the all of the se
all of the senses um if you go to the next slide there's slightly more detailed things about the movies
so the usual suspects is a hundred and five minutes long so it's a decent length of time
it has an r  rating so i don't remember what type of audience we had at the last
uh shows but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids
r  is sort of if you're eighteen and under you have to have an adult with you
it's mostly for violence yeah it's restricted um it got an eight point seven out of
ten on the internet movie database it's the sixteenth in the top f two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies
of the nineties it won um a couple of academy awards notably for best writing
um so that's for the script um and best actor for kevin spacey
mm hmm
yeah fourth in the top movies of the nineties sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty i think of all time
yeah
so it won lots of awards um it won best film from the british um british film association or the british equivalent of the academy awards um it was nominated for best foreign film for the cesar
plenty of awards yeah
i think of all time yeah
yeah
so
yeah

yeah it's ratings by viewers and
yeah like memories
yeah and forty four as well which has seven hundred and forty something votes
yeah so
yeah um
yeah no it's a good movie i i highly recommend it and i wouldn't mind seeing it again because i do know the ending and i haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie 'cause apparently there are hints as to who it is
yeah okay
yeah
and he's the one telling the story yeah
there's him and the the guy in the burn unit
the second movie is the sixth sense again it's fairly short it has an easier rating it's p g  thirteen um
it's much less violent it got an eight point one out of ten it's a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty
and it's nineteenth on your list i think if i'm not mistaken yeah it's nineteenth
um got a fair number of votes too ninety six thousand um again it was nominated
for a lot of different academy awards um it didn't win any but it got a lot
of buzz and a lot of people liked it so
those are my two selections and as you can see the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits that don't know when they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and
what it means
yeah yeah
yeah it's only right right at the end where you find out really what's going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand
so those would be my two suggestions and y they ar they are slightly more commercial or at leas the sixth sense is than the other ones we've seen but
yeah
yeah they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards they didn't win
but i guess the comp i can't remember what the competition was that year but
and they were nominated for a lot of them and um
yeah
so i think that's it unless you have any questions yeah that's it
you sent your slides around right yeah

no i haven't i've heard a lot of good things about it i've heard it's a really powerful movie but i haven't seen it
yeah it's set in a jail
yeah
me
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
it's a fairly emotional movie though that's one thing to keep in mind is that it's
yeah but amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either yeah and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four so

no
it is a good movie yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah

yeah
but it gets updated daily
yeah
mm no
wait how many of us saw schindler's list three of us did you see it i'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen
you have you have you haven't

i can't remember
i think also it's old enough that even if people saw it the first time around they don't necessarily remember everything that happened 'cause i remember seeing it when it came out but i don't particularly remember
so we've all seen it
is what
i haven't i don't remember the soundtrack
yeah i mean if there's something that none of us like we can just eliminate it but we might as well leave everything 'till the end
no

yeah
yeah it's a gangster movie
ray liotta and
joe pesci i think maybe i think yeah on the right and the guy on the left is ray liotta
i recognise them
i'm a movie buff i know way too much about movies and actors and everything
what was it about
very descriptive
no


a little bit okay
yeah
mm hmm
so the other killer is hannibal lecter who
yeah he's in jail and he's real no h
he tries to help the f b i  agent but he plays head games with the f b i  agent at the same time
and so
with her he manages to freak her out
so
hannibal lecter is a very
the moth
which the one who's in jail or the one who anthony hopkins
i don't either
yeah he's scary in that movie
yeah i vaguely remember what it is but
how many of us have seen it i'm guessing you haven't seen it or h okay
so have we all seen it okay so we've all seen it
i can't either 'cause i saw it right when it came out
it came out when ninety one yeah
so
yeah me too and at that age i was like mm
yeah that was very good yeah
yeah

yeah suburban life
there's a lot of very true things in it
yeah
yeah
it's much less dark than the other movies we have on that list
it's not well it's dark but no
no
but not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they're just everyone has their own issues and
no
well
with hi his daughter his like teenage daughter so that's the best friend and he fantasises about her and
mm hmm
see i don't know what was mainstream in europe like all of these movies are very mainstream for me
but
it has other movies but i think it's predominantly
no there's movies from everywhere but
mm hmm
yeah
no i've never even heard of it
oh okay
thank you
mm hmm
it's v very very violent
the landing yeah
yeah this is not a movie for kids like
yeah
yeah
yeah the redux version is longer
yeah
i think just once for this
oh maybe he did
no for e t  he didn't it wasn't until he started doing things like schindler's list and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for them
did he
oh okay yeah
i didn't know that
they re enhanced the colour yeah
that it was their t v s and not
mm hmm
yeah
yeah about two thirds of the way through the movie 'cause most of the movie is them find trying to find him on the front right no no
yeah he's trying to find him
private ryan was matt damon i think yeah
yeah
yeah
is it him at the begin it's him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard right
yeah with his family yeah
i have


i don't think so no it was an italian
mm hmm
yeah

no


mm hmm
mm it's julianne moore isn't it yeah
mm hmm

hmm
i quite like that
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
looks like a c d  cover
yeah
mm hmm
oh okay
i actually don't like it it looks like two yeah it's it looks like two separate posters
although i think you can mix i would keep the format of the first one add the quotes and the content information from the second one
so take those take those quotes get rid of that section of text put those
quotes in there put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club how to
join kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up
i think it does i think the contrast between the the the strip of film and or the strip of pictures and everything else is
yeah
yeah so take all of that content throw it up into the first one and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something yeah


usual suspects
mainly because only two of us have seen it and it's not a mainstream movie so i don't think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with
mm hmm

so you reduced that by what two
american beauty and
wait i'm missing one what am i missing pulp fiction was that one of them okay
i have seven

okay
pulp fiction
i'm not a huge fan of quentin tarantino and it didn't make a good impression
really eliminate pulp fiction it's gone
we're all gonna vote for something different
i i still like the usual suspects but i like american beauty too
so
usual suspects
you have the deciding vote
yeah


that's fine
it'll make a good change from the other ones
if you don't like it it's your problem
yeah
yeah
ascension
mm 'kay
okay
ninth ninth yeah twenty ninth

hi
hi everyone
i haven't
mm hmm
yes so who who has what actually maybe um
uh huh what do you have mirek
uh huh and i have a uh well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions what about you denis
uh huh
should we start with the two presentations maybe yeah
mm hmm
no i haven't seen it

um
mm hmm
so w what what is this s the second image on the slide is it the the poster or
has a s it has a strange format um horizontal and uh so it's one two three four five six
mm hmm
so it means restricted uh huh
yeah because your table is only the nineties yeah mm hmm

well
w w
no no actually if you look at your tables i think it's a sort of uh well average between number of votes and
and and uh yeah the the rating or th the marks because there are in you table you have uh things that have very
few votes but still are ranked quite high for instance number twenty four which has only four thousand votes
but um yeah
yeah maybe it's just the search is compensated a bit for the number of people i i don't know actually because if you have just ten votes and yeah probably are not in the database
but yeah anyway it has excellent votes haven't seen it but
mm hmm
oh

yep
mm hmm
the last sentence from the movie or oh
w
mm hmm
mm hmm
so these guys were actually nominated so the the bottom part of your slide actually it says yeah so these are the best awards they had
okay
too bad well there is just one winner so uh huh
okay
yeah i think your table is very clear denis

no i haven't
yeah
w what is the name in french 'cause
uh huh uh yeah
yeah well actually your third slide has the plot so uh
yeah
oh yeah exactly yeah so yeah this guy is jailed okay uh huh wow
okay
yeah
yeah i haven't seen i heard about it but
mm hmm yep
yeah

um i think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps actually
because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh yeah it's not bad and it's also i think it's a good idea
at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films like history im major events
i don't know if we want to keep this coherence or change radically but maybe yeah that's
yeah i think it's a drawback uh
well of the seventeen eighties
yeah maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties i don't know as for amadeus but uh that's i don't know but
yeah hard to tell
mm hmm
yeah it's funny actually um because on your on your slides actually the ratings are
eight point seven for both no they have the same usual suspects and pulp fiction both are at eight
point seven but on denis's table uh this one is at eight point six who knows maybe people
voted for it yeah could have changed in the meanwhile
though with one hundred and thousand votes it shouldn't change too much i mean given the number of votes i wonder but anyway it's m it may change i think yeah
okay wow that's encouraging
no
haven't
uh i i've seen very few movies from the list about ten out of the first fifty
okay yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i've seen it this one i i like it very much i've actually seen it
well it's plenty of well known songs and you know the twist thing and
oh i would keep it as a candidate but i don't know i think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates so we'll try to
yeah we should probably vote after everyone
yeah mm hmm
yeah
no


i you you recognise them or you can read the the text on the images oh okay
huh very well
mm hmm
yeah
mm okay no yeah so probably not uh


so
who is in prison actually
yeah
no no he tries to decrypt the the the other killers' behaviour
yeah well not very nasty ones or does he i don't know yeah
yeah that's basically the point yeah mm hmm so on the picture you can see uh jodie foster and uh ha ha
th th the moth
anthony hopkins the other one i don't remember we don't see any h see him very often but it's
mm hmm yeah
but the plot is quite horrible i mean the not the plot but the what the the active killer wants to do is quite horrible and
mm
okay
yeah i've seen it i think i've seen it a second time on t v  but maybe not entirely

they're much too young
indeed
i haven't seen it but i would like to see it so
mm hmm

mm hmm so it's not very violent really
ah okay great
mm hmm
okay yeah
uh huh and what about the well that picture with the the girl and do you see naked people in the movie or is it about sex or something like that
ah okay
supposedly okay
uh huh
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm yeah i think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them but also making them enjoy the show so that they
come to our movie club so yeah i think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies
but well okay the list here is quite uh
yeah
yeah i think also if you look at the number of votes here
uh
yeah uh regarding the denis's table i would say given that this site i don't know if it's mainly american but uh i would say that
yeah i think mm yeah it's english speaking anyway so uh though so
yeah but if you look at
yeah but i would say mainstream are the ones that have more than whatever sixty thousand votes
and you can see some more well confidential films that have like ten thousand
twenty thousand like mm princess mononoke twenty thousand and uh
whatever the the kieslowski at eleven thousand the trois coleurs rouge
yeah it's not bad at all yeah so yeah anyway if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever
mm hmm
yep
d uh danish i think it's the dogma movement yeah
yeah
yeah let's uh
yeah so it's uh actually i have made i have made photocopies i have them denis so it's all for you actually i i tried to propose just one movie with some alternates uh you want one
um so my proposal which is only a proposal would be to to keep the focus
on um uh more or less history and action so lawrence of arabia
was okay about this guy during the first world war so it happens okay outside europe and the states
but uh it's a piece of history uh apocalypse now it's uh vietnam if i'm um
correct and okay amadeus that's much uh much earlier and it's not about it's not violent which is a
nice thing i think but um given that we would like a movie from the nineties i thought
the saving private ryan oh thanks for projecting the document
um would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and
war and action drama while showing actually a very new and i would say
humanistic view on on war because it's it's not like the sort of glorification
of uh you know the good guys that that uh well go against the nazis but uh
it's uh it's well the plot actually if you don't know it
it's about people looking for just one soldier in fact it's um it's about a a family of
four brothers who actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty
well i guess summer forty four and the uh well the government decides that they
need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family and this this guy is private
ryan
so the movie is not about killing the germans or whatever it's about saving at least one guy from
a family so but of course the the setting is during the war and um it's very realistic
and uh very dramatic in fact it's um it's not at all a glorification of war but it's just uh
it shows a bit uh the violence of um of the things and especially the the beginning is uh
i think it's great it's it's very violent but it's it's an image of of war it's uh
yeah but i think if mm well if you compare it with
it yeah it's the landing and actually every more or less everyone gets killed and
oh i i didn't know but yeah actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic and i don't know if you compare
with i don't know in lawrence of arabia i think they have some battles and camels i know it's very nice someone falls somewhere there
and well you know it's like battles that look nice but this one doesn't look nice and i think it's
uh it's also maybe representative of the nineties you know people starting to get the more uh realistic view
of uh of of war but it's true it's it's a bit violent and so what i put here it's a bit
long too it's nearly three hours
but uh i don't know apocalypse now is quite long too i think
i don't remember
mm hmm
yeah so it won uh five oscar prizes uh best director for steven spielberg um best cimena cinematography etcetera uh
i don't know
oh
hmm
mm hmm
um okay so um yeah that's that's the point it's it's a bit grey and actually if you look
at my second page uh in the trivia i found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour
saturation of the movie just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time yeah i was
very surprised to find this uh it's
they they turned back the colours for uh
yeah
yeah so this uh fact number two i think obviously for i mean technical people like us is uh
is is is quite funny so yeah so i i mean these four points could serve also as an introduction
if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie i don't know in
in the room so uh yeah mm so tha this would be my candidate but i'm very much open
to
mm hmm
yeah on th on yeah on the picture actually yeah it's tom hanks in fact you you don't see uh private ryan until the end more or less or you see mm because they they're looking for him yeah
mm hmm
no tom tom
yeah well the caption says captain john miller so
so i if you look at the caption um yep so he's uh he's
yeah so the private is just a simple soldier actually yeah
uh who private ryan or no no they find him actually and they send him back to the family but the captain dies actually tom han
l
oh yeah it's private ryan yeah remembering at the beginning mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah exactly yeah he dies unfortunately so yeah there is sacrifices and
mm hmm
oh
mm hmm
yeah the german
uh huh yeah
well i mean yeah it has a moral dimension all over the movie you know saving the individual and the guys so
yeah i i don't know i don't know how many people have have seen it well among you well most of you actually oh all
okay all of us so maybe th people know it quite well
yeah okay so yeah so i have some other candidates um it's on first page at the bottom
uh i also put pulp fiction uh the silence of the lambs and i also well sort of included
la vita e bella but i know we're an engish movie club so i guess it's um it's a bit out of purpose
but it
oh it's uh it's about again about the camps and the second world war so it's about uh a family
of italians which uh g arrives into a a death camp and in fact it's treated in a more or less humorous
mode so um the father tries to hide from i from his boy that they are in a death camp
and it's this very strange mm well not really humour but relation between the uh
how
well the boy gets saved but the father dies yeah so i don't know i
it created some controversies i think because people said you shouldn't do any form of humour related to the camps but it's
very very moving so i think it's anyway um italian so
yep yeah
okay uh denis
haven't seen it but uh i heard it's very funny and i've seen some other films by by the coen brothers
yeah which is in your table
um the last one was the one with catherine zeta jones uh
crue crue
yeah something about cruelty or very funny
a movie or a novel
no but they say that raymond chandler wrote the novel you see it's the the last but one paragraph on your second page
i think so
mm
um
y you wrote the paragraph on the poster

okay could be edited a bit

yeah yeah there are two lebowskis in the film
mm hmm
yeah there should be a reference there
yeah
mm hmm
yeah it's probably a bit dark for a poster but otherwise it's very nice
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh okay it's a dream

okay sounds a bit crazy
yeah
hmm
uh huh
yeah
i like it because it's not so dark so the images are a bit um brighter

yeah yeah
yeah mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
wh what about a brighter background because this one i don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this it doesn't really catch your attention
'kay
yeah
mm
yeah okay
yeah no the content was very good in the second one th
yeah all this information is very good
mm hmm
oh or just one of them
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh yeah w
i i would suggest
if it's not too long maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies we make a list and then we vote
what do you think
so who wants so mirek what do you nominate
you are okay
in the nominees okay another nominee
okay agnes usual suspects
mm hmm
yeah well you can nominate one or two so that we or whatever um i would nominate well okay my candidate saving private ryan
and uh i'm happy with your nominations too uh i would nominate also pulp fiction because it's a very good movie
um denis so your yours is already nominated but you want
yeah

okay so it's already on the list
mm hmm
yeah if you want
so
so we have uh seven candidates um if you have a good short
term memory that should be okay yeah so uh big lebowski usual suspects
saving private ryan pulp fiction american beauty schindler's list and silence of the lambs so now
let's vote should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give
okay
so big lebowski
alright
uh you can write on your paper maybe
and saving private ryan
so
yeah pulp fiction yeah okay so each of us chooses one to eliminate
okay denis
okay i will just remove it this way um um
i would remove schindler's list because it's too sad
well it's not very good reason but
oh too bad

no no well i mean leave someth okay so we're left with the big lebowski usual suspects saving private ryan and american beauty
okay so let's vote just simply for one for the moment
so i would vote for american beauty because i haven't seen it
um so mirek big lebowski agnes denis
uh
yeah you can choose
y you're the president maybe after all uh
okay yeah i think i'm quite fine
is it a b yeah i think at least it's funny and uh that's nice okay
so
decision
mm hmm
that's your fault mirek
no no no i mean yeah it's you voted for it but i'm quite happy with it i haven't seen it
well beginning of may i guess to choose the film for may is that
yeah the fifth is um ascension what's that going up to the sky
yeah we can do it like the tuesday before the ascensions and that's may third
so yeah so thanks for the posters actually denis they are very nice
okay
see you on what april twenty sixth or what's the mm twenty ninth okay
hello
no i haven't
thank you
mm hmm
okay i have a powerpoint presentation and uh it's about there are some reviews of the of the i think like seven movies
no i haven't

hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
nineties yeah
so plenty of awards we we could say
of all the movies yeah yeah
it's still good actually
by the users

so it's definitely just the average of the rating and okay th the number of the votes is there just for the information so that you know how how reliable yeah
yes
mm
okay
okay then you yeah then yes yes yes yes sure


mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm mm hmm
and what is the second movie
yeah sixth sen
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay now you can go to to my slides but actually what i pre what i have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies if you ca can go to the second slide
yes basically seven movies and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra ranking and a and awards
awards um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the
wall so um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss so
i i i have n i didn't see all of them actually so it's just we should probably select
one of these because i think uh these are really good movies and uh okay we will see so
if you can go through uh okay so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m it's more like
a drama uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked and actually you have a a nicer list because uh we can
even see the number of the votes so what is the number of the people
finally i found actually your table much better than my than my presentation because perhaps here we can we can really see i mean
what is the ranking we ha didn't have the plot yeah
yeah who has seen this movie because then perhaps someone can give some some comment
mm hmm
yeah it's this one it's the one that is on the on the wall it's projected yeah
so i ge okay so no one of us saw this movie so in that case perhaps it's it's little bit danger to select that movie for the for the
s play so uh schindler's list who saw this
i saw it and i think this on is re um this one is really nice it's uh you know all a all of you knows the the story so
uh it's quite hi it's quite high ranked so i think uh it's not a bad movie i'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion uh something what has happened recently there was something like a celebration of the
fifty years after the war or something recently no
no that's
sixty yeah s it can't be fifty sure
yeah so
mm hmm
that's true

yes yes yes yes
um but even here i wouldn't uh uh say that the that th this style is representative of the nineties right so
um
okay but uh anyway i think it's it's really a good movie i like it when i saw it and uh okay
it's one of the candidates i defini yeah steven spielberg is really quite a good so i director so i i would say we we could think about it so i would keep it as a candidate at least
that's the second one
um no i think we can just skip this slide
uh yeah
it's
that's strange what is the rating
perhaps it has changed
it's higher
it gets updated
yes yes and i did it i did it on wednesday
yes
mm hmm so it probably has changed so um
it becomes more popular no po uh yeah yeah yeah
uh schindler's list i saw it i saw it
mm hmm


okay pulp fiction uh i think it's again quite uh hi high ranked uh but from my perspective
everyone already saw it who was interested in that movie he saw it wh who is not interested in that movie he
he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club so i think we should
uh we should just leave skip it out and leave it out i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate even if it's a good
movie but i don't know i think it's
yes yes there was ple i i think there was a plenty of loops actually plenty of
i fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new but uh on the other hand i have the impression it's really it's uh you know every everyone saw it it's it's quite well known uh it woul it wou i
yeah
me neither
mm so what do you think i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate because it seems to me it's
mm hmm
vote that's the best yeah yeah
when going through we c we could just eliminate okay so we are not gonna eliminate this one uh goodfellas i didn't see it
no but you can read the comment from the users uh that's the that's the last uh bullet point and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh and it's uh scorsese's last really great movie to date
mafia yes
i can't recognise them from the picture the picture is not very good quality



and it's a movie from nineties the one that you saw that you mentioned
yeah
no
silence of the lambs uh
should i tell something more godfather of all thrillers that's what it what it says on the
what some uh user says uh so okay it's a little bit horror so i think it's quite it's uh
it's uh
it's definitely not for kids uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema why not
it
one have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie you have to think and it's uh scaring uh why not
mm hmm mm hmm
so the f b i  agent is assigned to to help uh find a a missing woman and uh save her f uh her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer
yeah
he's in prison yes
he's a really psychotic man
mm hmm
mm hmm

anthony
no but he plays it really good anthony hop hopkins he really plays it very good very good yeah
so


i've i've see i've seen it but i can't really remember exactly the all the details
uh
it's a long time ago it's from ninety one
ninety one yeah
so and i saw it when i was like twelve or thirteen so perhaps it would be
yeah could you go to the next slide
yeah it's here and that's actually my last slide so um
i don't know because it nicely f i i was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them
uh
so american beauty so i can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want or uh yeah you can read the plot outline
on the on the on the projector but it's basically deep wonderful and penetrating movie extraordinary
uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about american life

poetic
okay the way of filming perhaps but uh
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
and it's my last slide so uh yes yes yes and i think okay why not
it seems to me that perhaps that schindler okay definitely schindler schindler's list is perhaps more serious topic for
sure but um well it depends it depends what we want do we want that people are more like
uh relaxed in our in our cinema or are more interested in some particular things
um what do you think i mean what should we how we should uh
what should be the influence how we are influencing the people in the cinema
um
what do we want
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm hmm
maybe can i ask you for the for the list of movies
this one and the
denis denis could you give me the the list of the to uh top fifty yeah but you have your own copy then okay good thank you
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

that's the i i i saw it and i d i'm trying to remember the beginning that's the normandy landing okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was really horrible
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
no not at all
mm hmm
because people start to complain that uh that w there was a problem with a t v  when they were broadcasting the movie on the t v  uh
that's an interesting point interesting point
yeah but in the end you can ref yes
no
mm hmm
by the way did he fied dinally uh f fi died finally or not
uh the private ryan yeah
th they i remember i remember they found him but ah okay yes yes yes
because i remember
mm hmm
because i remember that th in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and uh finally it's actually john miller who die okay okay
it's not the private ryan
mm hmm
perhaps it was a g uh this uh tom hanks yeah
oh yeah yeah
if he would kill him he wouldn't die wow tom hanks wouldn't die
i've seen it i've seen it
out of time
mm hmm

what is the movie about the la vita e bella
ah ha
mm hmm
uh huh
uh huh uh huh
how it end up what is the what is the ending of the movie
mm hmm mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm
that's actually the third movie about the second war schindler's list a p uh saving private ryan and la vita e bella
mm hmm
just partially i think
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm why the movie is called the big lebowski why the big uh lebowski is his uh family name right but why it's called the big
okay and why the big lebowski it's the it's the second one or
uh huh ah okay okay uh huh

mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
i think this is not bad because they say something little bit about our uh movie club and uh yeah the big lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh i guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least even if they haven't see it
cd cover
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah but i on the contrary i would say there is too many colours and uh it's difficult to read and uh
yeah that would be the best


yeah all this information and put into the first one mm hmm
if if they fit there if they fit there you will see
mm hmm
so big lebowski
mm hmm okay good idea
so i'm really convinced by the big lebowski i yes yeah i i would like to uh yeah at least to have it uh in the
in the nominees exactly and uh i'm trying to remember all of them
mm hmm mm hmm
and then i'm still hesitating between the schindler's list and the s uh silence of the lambs
may i nominate uh these all these three movies big lebowski schindler's list and the silence of the lambs
mm hmm

so eliminate first eliminate first mm hmm
i'm sorry could you go t uh uh uh once again through uh the list of the movies because i don't or i is it possible to put them on the on the on the uh whiteboard
okay okay so the schindler's list the usual suspects uh silence of the lambs uh big lebowski okay
saving private ryan
one two
pulp fiction okay
i have six i have six how many okay we american beauty

okay

yeah and i would eliminate
yeah and i would eliminate pulp fiction actually as well if so
another one because it because it would be saving private ryan
mm
i vote for big lebowski
make a decision

already ready yeah
so
so it's gonna to be big lebowski
okay

no no no no no i i like it i like it
okay beginning of may but there are there is plenty of holidays at the beginning of may no
ascension
mm hmm okay okay no problem
good
twenty nine
really looking forward i want to see it
hi
so i don't know if you all received the the a agenda for this meeting do you no
here it is
so um um the goal for today are um we have two goals
uh first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club as
you know uh so it's for the last friday of this month of april as you probably remember
the movie already projected were uh lawrence of arabia and apocalypse now in february
and amadeus from milos forman in march
so um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties
and which movie so that's the first goal decide for a movie to be projected and second goal is to
uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um
uh club because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection
so that's it um wh who wants to start to
so i guess you all prepared some documents for the mm selection of movie
okay
okay
yeah i have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favourite movie
okay so
presentation yeah okay a agnes we can start with you
okay here it is
i passed this one
which which one was it again the guy who was controlling i don't remember i have seen the movie twice but uh
it's the bald guy the
no no okay
yeah it's a bit more commercial that one first one
um
r  is what uh in
okay
restricted
but wait i i have the top ten from the nineties no the top fifty and it's fourth
oh sorry sorry yep yeah yeah
from yeah yeah yeah
but but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty it's what two uh all all days all time
okay
but those rating are more like uh it's the number of votes no
votes and u
yep

and rating
yep
yeah yeah
yep
okay yep
ah now i remember
yep
actually there is one guy who is the at the police station and they ask him to tell the story yeah yeah
both movies are quite similar in some way because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie it's uh
yeah the last sentence from the movie
yeah
okay you have a last slide or no
okay
okay
yeah one hundred f w uh one hundred forty thousand

no we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh
okay but maybe we can wh who has seen this movie
i uh
i think i i i've seen it actually but
i have no idea
it it's in uh jail right it taking yeah
i don't remember well this movie
yep
okay okay
okay so mm
yep so let's

yeah i've seen it also
sixty s sixty years
yep yep that's right yeah
but then it's not representative of the nineties it's more a movie about the story of uh the horror of the uh endured by the jewish during the second world war
yeah right

yeah yeah
okay and steven steven spielberg is uh
okay
okay the usual suspect do we want to say something again about it or
how come it's coming third
on your list
it's forth on agnes's uh and on my list but it's okay ah you j you selected some movies no you didn't take the six first
and me on tuesday probably
okay do we have something to add on this movie or
okay
yep
yep
that's why you are in the movie club to see more movies
why not it's quite representative of the nineties i think and the structure of the movie is interesting
i i think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene no there is a kind of loop in this movie
yep
yeah yeah i agree also yeah
you've you've seen it okay
and the soundtrack is uh is gorgeous also no you don't the soundtrack
no
yeah yeah
w w we vote at the end or you want to
okay
no
ah it's scorsese's
it's uh yeah again a movie about uh on mafia no
with uh robert de niro and who are the o two other guys i cannot
ah joe pesci yeah on the r on the right you mean yeah

it's the exact same actors who played in um another mafia movie that i cannot rememb les affranchis it was the name in french no
about uh mafia uh it that's why i tha that's why i didn't go to see this one it's quite i it seems to me they're all about the same subject and the same i don't know
probably yeah
okay n nobody's seen it so
okay

so it's about a psychopathic killer
and
what was it again the plot i mea the
he he's in jail and he's still killing
ah okay yeah yeah
yep
who's playing the ps psychopath again i don't
yeah
okay yeah
okay
no i've seen it actually twice i think
that's it's it's probably begin
ninety one
yep
okay american beauty w w was coming next seven was quite quite nice actually
ah it's actually there
why you choose you choose seven movie
okay
yeah it's definitely about american life
it's it's kind of crude the critique but uh on the other way it's quite poetic it's uh yeah
yeah you know with the the way of filming and um i don't know i found it pretty
no it's q it's quite in interesting
so yeah
well it depends
ah no it's it's not violent at all but more it's more the cr the cr the critique that is quite crude because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way
but they are normal people then
yeah
actually there is this it's uh uh what a fifty years old man that quit his job and fall in love with um the best friend of his daughter
yeah it's it's good movie
okay
you have seen it mirek
i think we w want them to to see movies that they won't see oth otherwise but i'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected so
if they are in the top fifty they are quite mainstream but uh
uh i think there is the
there are chinese movies english movies
it's it's quite a lot for kieslowski actually i was surprised to s yeah yeah
and festen also is uh is quite high uh i i don't know if you've seen this one it's the celebration i think it's uh uh movie from a swedish guy
danish dogma movies yeah lars von trier
yeah
okay can we
discuss about your document maybe
yep
okay
okay

yeah sure
yep
yeah it's quite horrible actually
yeah
mirek you didn't see it
yeah
but it's it's a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that or
yep
yeah it's quite s yeah
yeah it is there is two there are two versions i think and but w but we yeah we projected the longer one so
how many times uh spielberg received the best uh director oscar
not for the schin schindler's list or for
for e t 
he won f he won the mm
no he won f for e t  he won the mm cannes uh what is uh palme d'or
yeah
that was very interesting to read yeah
but then they uh i read that they they w where was it th they turned back to yeah

and then then there is this uh there is an hero i mean it's uh or a non hero and
in all the other stu stories the in the previous movies there were an he an hero lawrence of arabia
uh amadeus apocalypse now it's also non hero i think but uh but here
i don't remember it's actually the tom hanks the hero or it's
he's private ryan tom hanks no he's not he's trying to find him
yeah yeah
okay
at the end to tell you the truth i didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic because there were a guy
who was who didn't kill german because he was quite non violent and because he didn't
kill this german the german killed i don't know uh maybe um
yep
and it was like if he had killed the mm
because he e yeah

yeah
i have
yeah
yeah we're running um

but it was in english no
yep so i have uh a quite different movie to propose you i don't know
uh it's f called the big lebowski from um uh joel coen actually they are brothers
you probably know them i don't know how many of you have seen this movie
no
yeah they made uh fargo which is in the list
and uh
uh cr uh cruel intentions or something like that i think or
okay so i don't know how i'm going to sell you this movie because actually the plot is impossible to make because it's um actually it's inspired from a movie called the big sleep and um
uh it's actually the t where i've seen that in a it's uh a movie from raymond chandler the big sleep it's uh
ah okay
yeah yeah yeah so it's it's uh it's a novel okay
but uh then the story goes that while that film was in production and director okay
okay you're right it was a book okay so it's about a a g a guy
who called the d the dude i don't know you pronounce it and uh he's actually uh
smoking pot and doing nothing just um he's living in l a  it's uh it's a typical
typical fellow from the from the suburb and he has some friends uh typical
friends one one is uh an old guy from coming back from vietnam obsessed by vietnam
um another guy who is never speaking and they all play together uh bowling
and um the casting is very interesting there is um okay actually i wanted
to propose you some posters related to this movie uh maybe it w maybe it's
going to open the discussion on on posters as well
so actually here you on this the first poster you can see the actors from the movie i don't know if
you know some of them so jeff bridges at the top uh goodman is the second one the b the
big guy then turturro and uh uh the last one is buscemi and
i don't remember the name of the girl
yeah julianne moore
uh i i took it from i don't know where so uh
actu
actually i'm not going to sp to describe much more the big lebowski but uh it's quite hard to describe it's uh
it's it's a journey about this guy but it's it's a movie quite surrealistic i mean there
are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh
yeah it's his family name and uh actually jeffrey lebowski and he's he's the there is a a story with another lebowski that yeah
and uh
i i i don't remember maybe it's just uh uh because of the big sleep there is uh
i don't know a reference so it's a kind of it's like american beauty in some way it's
even worse we see worse people so it's kind of uh an ethnographic movie i would
say but uh and it's a modern hero it's it's quite fun and the casting is is marvellous so that
is that's it for this movie and um i just wanted to go to the design
of the poster actually
because
yeah
yep
the idea is is also to discuss the content shall we put a summary of the movie or the plot and w what kind of information do we want so that's the first poster
there is alo um this poster quite dark also
uh so y y i don't know if you you cannot really see but uh mm there is the the
pricing information so we said that one movie is eight francs and three movies eighteen francs
and we can have annual subscrip subscription of sixty francs
uh i wanted to say some information to involve people on in the committee as well if they want to take part to the committee to select movies
and uh what else
s some
yeah actually the idea was to s yeah there is at the bottom the a scene from one of these dream of the big lebowski
and uh the the first part is actually y you see a cowboy and the the hero the jeffrey lebowski
the dude and the cowboy it's actually at the beginning of the movie the c the cowboy introduce the story
and he's coming back at the end of the story and he's e explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to
to see
and last posters
so same principle but i w i don't know i w i was thinking of adding some some um cita quotations of uh well known directors
and uh


yeah
okay
okay
okay i see
and yeah
okay i see what i wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie uh what y you want to have on the poster
because we di we
okay on that one
okay
okay great so i think now we have to decide for a movie
and um
yep
so
yep i th

i would nominate uh
american beauty as well
and um
and i would be okay with saving private ryan it's it's it can

or we can eliminate first one one movie each and then we s and then we select

okay
okay
yeah that's a bit cruel but uh that's i think a good way
me i would remove silence of the lambs because i think it's too violent

and you have a reason for it or okay
maybe you can eliminate another one you can no
w

agnes you v
o
okay now i have the if we want okay if we want to take a okay
okay so i'll go with the big lebowski since the posters are already ready
yeah i think
okay
so we have other anyway so can we decide for uh a next meeting maybe
okay
okay o or we'll decide after the projection of the movie the date it's okay
okay okay
you're welcome
okay thank you
and uh see you at the projection
no twenty ninth
okay

are you gonna take the minutes
good
hello
um i don't do you have an extra copy thanks
okay

mm hmm
sure
okay so the previous movies that we've done this year were lawrence of arabia apop apocalypse now and
amadeus which were all historical serious dramatic and somewhat actiony movies
so for this month i propose doing something different preferably something set in the present um something
maybe dramatic but slightly less serious so what i'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery
and while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries
some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying never saw that
coming i didn't know that that was gonna happen
and so what i'm gonna do is present you two of those movies and before anyone says that well if you know th how the movie ends you're not gonna
wanna see it again that's not necessarily the case because a lot of people like to re watch movies
um to see where the clues were what they missed things they didn't pay attention to the first time around um
so if you can go to the next slide what i'd propose is either the usual suspects or the sixth sense
um the usual suspects is slightly less mainstream um is has a fairly
large cast notably kevin spacey gabriel byrne um and it was directed
by bryan singer it's one of his earlier movies i think it was written by quist christopher mcquarrie
um and according to rolling stone it's the freshest funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since
pulp fiction uh the sixth sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its
famous line i see dead people um it was written and directed by m  night uh shyamalan
and stars bruce willis haley joel osment and toni collette and it's about a little boy who sees dead
people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people what it means
now that you've given away the twist yes um
yeah
send your complaints to rolling stone so on the next couple of slides i'll just go through some of
um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes um the length for the usual suspects
um is a hundred and five minutes uh as you can s well as andrei already said it's n nineteen ninety five
it has an r  rating which means that at least in the in north america it was not recommended for
people under eighteen 'cause it's fairly violent but not so violent as other movies um
plot outline uh five villains in new york are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them
after release they get together for a spot of revenge but someone else is controlling events and the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling
the events
um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the internet movie database it's sixteenth in the top
two hundred and fifty movies of all time forth in denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties which i think
was also taken from i m d b  um it won several academy awards
including best supporting actor and best writing um best film for the british equivalent of the academy awards
it was nominated for a cesar for best foreign film so it got a fair bit of recognition despite not
being
um a very mainstream high budget movie or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream high budget movie
i don't think a lot of people have seen it in fact other than
you haven't seen it you haven't seen it you've seen it
and don't think a lot of people have seen it it's not a very very well known movie what
is it
see
really
that surprises me i always got the impression that it was
yeah well it's a good movie
yeah
yeah
so but i think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and
it's it's an interesting movie to watch
um so if you go to the next slide more or less the same thing for the sixth sense it's slightly newer nineteen ninety nine
more or less the same amount of time it has a lower rating 'cause it's less violent but it depends what audience we are
gonna have at the showings
it has it's scary and i think it has some sort of slight violence but
yeah but they're not violently dead
it's it's morbid and it's creepy but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that
um um it's nineteenth in the top movies of
the nineties hundred first in the top two hundred fifty it was nominated for a lot of awards it didn't
win
as many might have won more sort of minor awards but at least the academy awards it was nominated for five of them um but didn't win nevertheless still a good movie still a good twist at the end which denis already gave away
good um so those would be my two choices
let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen and they have a twist so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go oh okay get up and leave it's at least out of those two movies i came out thinking oh cool okay
yeah but
i mean that's a good thing right
yes
yeah
which is a good marketing ploy if you think about it
yeah bruce willis is and the kid is really good who plays the the main character
yeah yeah
same guy
no
i've heard a lot of really good things about it but
mm hmm
yeah i think it's about three hours long something like that
and it's a heavy movie i it's emotional it's
i think it did
either for director if not for best picture
yeah
mm
yeah i've seen it
yeah yeah that was his comeback movie yeah
yeah
it's uma thurman yeah
uh maybe 'cause i m d b  is updated daily so if it happens that people had voted for it
mm hmm
have you
but it is this movie
ah okay
okay

yeah
yeah i wouldn't be surprised
no it's later than that isn't it
yeah

i don't know but it was a good performance creepy
yeah
i think so yeah
when did it come out
yeah
as are we all
yeah me too
i don't think i've seen it since then
ah
no on the seco uh second one
yeah

it wasn't that good but i think it was almost more disgusting in a way
there were some scenes in it where normally i don't get queasy watching movies but that was just too much
it might be a little bit too violent
for i dunno
yeah
that's a good movie
yeah it's kevin spacey
quite possibly yeah
yeah
theoretically yeah

yeah
yeah
morgan freeman
mm hmm
mm hmm
well let's go through the other suggestions
i do
yeah
mm hmm
up close
yeah
it's very different i don't think you can compare them
also sets the mood a little bit
darker and
yeah but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it
mm hmm
yeah he's private ryan
well
they're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died
most of them get killed don't they yeah
yeah
mm mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
i tried to
mm hmm

mm hmm

mm hmm
or is that the other lebowski
oh okay


buscemi yeah
really

mm hmm yeah
i think it looks too much like a c d  cover though
i like the layout of the first one and the content of this one
it looks like two different posters though
it's hard to read
the paragraph i think was a little bit long
i would and content of the second one
yeah
yeah like what you have there
and then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of
descriptions not even of the whole plot but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause i think
that paragraph is too long people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing
mm hmm


it's here forty eight
i hope more people have seen it
mm hmm

um i'd go for sixth sense just because it's different from all the other ones and
maybe shawshank redemption just because we haven't seen it
mm hmm
yeah


okay um
okay
okay um
so i'll
i'll give two to american beauty and
mm
one to the big lebowski
okay so it's pretty clear
american beauty
well you can keep the format i mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one
yeah
okay
yes but of the wrong movie that's the real twist
no she's not
no it's who is it annette bening who's the m the main character the well the main female character the mother
when do you want these images by
just quickly
day after tomorrow
two thousands
third isn't it
monday may third
we can ask people casually sort of what genre of movie they want or
start again
or go back to the fifties
okay
american beauty
it's just that i need uh some some white paper
uh yes
um hello
yes i did
mm
ah
no but we're the clubbers but
agnes uh i was just wondering uh i see uh i have here denis's table and when they say that it's the
freshest whatever since pulp fiction well that's probably not a very long time because pulp fiction
is ninety four and usual suspects is ninety five okay
yeah


mm hmm
mm hmm
i haven't seen it
really
oh
it's it's hard to tell so that's your impression yeah that's mine but uh
yeah how many people voted for it yeah that's true
mm hmm
yeah
isn't violent at all in fact or it's more like scary or
uh huh
scary or yeah mm hmm creepy or

mm hmm
have you seen it
okay
mm hmm
okay
ah
if we show it twice

okay so is bruce willis the child psychologist ah great
mm hmm
yeah it's the guy who then played in uh artificial intelligence or something like this mm hmm
great
mm
uh me neither
i thi
so uh i was told that in french it was called uh les evadees
yeah
should we should we believe this

mm hmm
yeah maybe even best picture yeah mm hmm
but yeah indeed it's maybe too sad and too yeah too poignant for
well

mm hmm
yeah i've seen it too yeah it's it's very good and it's a bit violent but it's also quite funny i think
it's a
mm hmm
yeah

the boxer
pardon
yeah as the boxer
uh uma thurman


mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah it's strange with so many votes that they can p shift i mean statistically speaking it's strange

mm hmm
wow
mm
but it was that movie okay


mm hmm
okay
not really in favour of this but
ah

mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah i think yeah when yeah i saw this movie some time ago and yeah she looked quite young i thought
ninety one


mm hmm

okay oh yeah i've seen it yeah yeah it's a good movie i um i don't know maybe too well known but since it's fifteen years old maybe people would li
yeah
mm hmm
oh again

mm hmm
i see
s mm hmm mm hmm
ah that's the girl who is represented on the the picture
you recognise her belly
uh
oh so you recognise the rose

mm hmm
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah but didn't i mean i see this name of the the director on the slide but i don't really know him frank darabont
never heard of this guy
mm hmm
yeah i'm not sure yeah
mm hmm
yeah maybe but it's true yeah we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table though it's a very useful table but um okay do you want me to yeah
so yeah uh i wrote some notes on um on saving private ryan which is my candidate if you can display
them it's perfect uh do you all have a copy of them i have some paper copies
uh you're welcome so actually given that more or less our
theme since the beginning of the year was um history drama
action and given also that well we decided to to present this month a movie from
the the nineties um i thought that among these movies who look quite popular
uh saving private ryan would be a very good candidate um
actually it's a movie i've seen have you seen it before okay so you've all seen it so maybe everyone has seen it i'm
not very sure um but i think it's a very novel treatment of of war it's uh
it's no longer the b glorification of uh whatever combat and victory but the plot
is quite different it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the
in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed so uh the government
believes that they should save at least one person from the family and saving means actually removing from the
the front if you if re if you remember the plot
so in fact this guy the private ryan is not at all the main actor the the main a well the main character
is uh played by tom hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes
uh captain john miller so he is sent with this rather strange mission which is not a combat mission
but they uh they want just to to get this guy back which is in fact this guy is i think behind
enemy lines or something like this so it happens in in europe just after the the normandy landing
and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's
it's very dramatic it's uh it's not you know like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall
and die anonymously but here they well you see everything and you see how many people die on that day
it's actually
well it's very strange you could s ask this for any sad movie did you enjoy it well i didn't really enjoy to see bad
things but uh i think it was satisfying to see that well how dramatic things are yeah
exactly yeah i it's very moving i it's true it's not very it's not very well happy
i don't know how it would compare with apocalypse now if it's darker or maybe
yeah so yeah so i think this would continue a bit our our theme so the the movie is ranked
quite high if i if i refer back to your table it's number uh what actually
um fourteen quite a lot of votes so um also one of the the mainstream movies
um on the second page uh of my notes i well i quoted some uh
well some facts about the movie that i found interesting we we could use them for either a poster or uh
or a presentation um especially i enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation it's true that
the movie is not really black and white uh but uh the colours are grey ish
dark ish it it prov it makes a very moving effect
yeah i think also to show the um yeah i think it's the reference to history and also this dark
yeah the mood and uh things are actually well most of the things are quite grey you know the uniforms
weapons things and things like that
mm hmm
exactly
mm hmm
mm hmm
well i think matt damon is the guy who must be saved if i remember well and in fact the die
well yeah the people didn't understand why they should save one person
so and they are quite resentful because they i mean they feel they should fight they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back and in fact some of them d get killed for this guy actually most of them yeah i think so
so
yeah yeah it's a very i think some people compare it with uh whatever christian message or i dunno but um i think it's quite quite universal and it's uh i think it's a modern very modern
well this uh value of one individual it looks like a christian message you know the value of one is
compared to others i i don't know i th i think i heard this at that point but maybe i'm just wrong so yeah i
i think it would make a coherent choice it's probably a bit long and we might want
something that is lighter and funnier but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history
and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it it it would make for a good choice
but if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page i put some other candidate movies
uh la vita e bella is an italian one but it's also about history and it happens at t the same period
as schindler's list and i also quoted pulp fiction and silence of the lambs um
a bit more remote from the themes but quite well known movies and enjoyable i would say
so do you have any questions about this or should we just move to the next candidate maybe
okay
it's just below the table so since we all refer to the table

mm hmm
yeah no i think the summary is i is quite good and especially i think it uh well mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie i think it looks funny for me i haven't seen the movie but uh the summary looks funny

mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
actually who are the two characters on the the p the poster on the on the image that
uh huh
and w and which one is the big lebowski on the picture
okay so the guy with the glasses
the vietnam guy

hmm

well sort of
oh
mm hmm
oh
yeah you cannot read it very well because
mm
uh huh yeah the text on this one is very good
oh because it's square
uh huh
yeah i don't like the black one the f the first poster is i think much uh much too dark
no that's nice
yeah
yeah
mm hmm yeah maybe two or three sentences because i guess they won't stop in front of the poster
yep
so layout of the first one
and colours of the third one

yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
oh okay
so the woman on the second picture that's julianne moore or oh
ah
interesting so it's not really violent or i mean the movie is quite for general audiences okay
okay
huh
well at least voted for it

mm
yeah
yeah let's nominate first
and then we vote we choose from the list
mm hmm
well i'll nominate the one i proposed saving private ryan so history war drem drama and i haven't seen it but i would like to see it and i think american beauty
if you if you think that our series okay it's not about america but uh still apocalypse well yeah it's about countries so agnes denis
so denis are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something
mm hmm
okay
so what if we voted say like for first and second choice and then we count you can give two points to one and one point to another one would you like this strange way to vote
um okay so uh
oh yeah um well it's uh well if i nominated two and i was the only one i'll give two points to saving private ryan and one to american beauty
you don't want to finish denis then you'd better hurry
okay
okay that makes the vote more complicated um okay so i'll give um uh b um
okay two to the sixth sense and one to the big lebowski

i note that you didn't nominate a film so you are sort of freer than us agnes okay oh
american beauty four big lebowski three so you have to redo the posters uh
mm
mm hmm
you mean the first poster yeah
maybe you can leave those

oh leave julianne moore
okay i'm looking forward to seeing it i haven't see it so
um so we have to select the movie for may
so uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands
and we can meet at the beginning of may so i think monday is second
no monday is third already
mm whatever
okay
yeah how many people we got and uh
mm hmm
maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods i think there is a godard with a lot of um quotations from other movies or well let's see when we
let's cross the bridge when we get to it
thanks see you april ni twenty ninth american beauty
hello
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm


i haven't see it

it's a

one hundred thousand one hundred and two for for voted for it yeah
more votes yeah it's it seems to be quite popular
mm hmm mm hmm
okay
mm hmm

mm hmm



yeah
so my presentation is not that detailed i just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies
and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them just to re remind you them and then we
can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates
okay so the movies that i have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so
uh shaw the shawshank redemption schindler's list usual suspects pulp fiction goodfellas silence of the lambs and american
beauty uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f to the first movie uh the shawshank
redempt uh redemption um actually i didn't see that movie so is there
someone else who have seen this movie
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay the plot outline says that the life of andy uh dufresne duf
okay of andy changes when he uh he's uh convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife and the user comment
says it's simply amazing the best uh film of the nineties so that's uh what it says
okay we can't tell much more because basically none of us have seen it
mm hmm yeah so the second one is a schindler's list it's more serious movie it's from the st uh
steven spielberg and it's about the second war uh sec second world war uh the plot outline is that the
oskar schindler uh uses jews to uh start a factory in poland during the war and he witnesses the uh horrors
uh endured by the jews and starts to save them user comment says a film for all to see
and learn and i think it's really something what is very serious uh theme and uh yeah
so that's a schindler's list um we can perhaps do you have some comments i i have seen it i think it's really good movie it's uh it's quite long actually i can't uh here i didn't put the the minutes but i think it's it's at least about three hours
yeah
no i don't know i don't know unfortunately
but i would expect it i would expect it okay so if you can go to the
it's a true story yeah it's it's yeah i would say that the user comment says everything a film to see and to learn
and to remember as well yeah
okay th so the third one is the usual suspects so i think i i wouldn't uh i don't want to comment it again so we can just skip that because it was this this is the one already commented by agnes so let's go to the to the other one
pulp fiction i would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties uh it's
uh directed by quentin tarantino it's a it's a crime and drama it's a a there i there are several s several
stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie and uh
yeah it's a real classical movie i would say almost nowadays so
i've seen it
so all of us
sure sure you can see it several times because i mean the first time you cannot catch all the details and then i when you see it second times and third times it's
it's big comeback yeah big comeback of john travolta yes i would say good comeback
yes who is there huh
yeah yeah yeah bruce willis is there as a boxer yeah
um
yes
okay so that's pulp fiction definitely should be considered uh
mm hmm
wow that's interesting
how
that may be
yeah because yeah because i have i have uh i have th this review on on wednesday
okay it's

goodfellas i haven't see that movie the plot outline says that the henry hill and the his friends uh work their way uh
their way up through the mob uh hierarchy and uh the user comment says it's a simply
a masterpiece so and if you go to the to the to the votes there is quite a lot of people who
has vote for the goodfellas sixty six thousand okay it's
it's modern day average so it's perhaps not a bad movie i dunno i haven't see that
you have seen it
yeah
mm hmm
uh huh and how i was it called mafia
mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm
so it talks about the nineteen twen twenties or something like o of twenties
mm hmm
okay so
mob is mafia mm hmm
okay
silence of the lambs that's a godfather of all thrillers i would say fully in line with the user comments
uh basically it's a it's a thriller horror and crime all together the
plot outline says that the uh clarice starling the young f b i  agent is assigned to help a f to help
find a mi uh missing woman and save her from the ps psychopathic killer with the help of another killer
this another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh anthony hopkins and he really plays it a very good i would say i'm not
sure whether he received some a awards for that but it's really it's
yes very good performance very good performance
yeah and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector
um
uh ninety one uh ninety one uh
so nowadays she's already fourteen years older yeah
and i saw this movie when i was like uh twelve or thirteen and it was really really uh bad experience so i can't remember all the details of that movie but i would like to see it again
i recently i saw the the uh hannibal that the seco the sec uh it was a third third part actually it was called hannibal i guess
it was second one yeah
so that's why

it was really disgusting yeah
yeah
and the last choice that um i think it's it's not a bad movie it's uh american beauty uh
it's basically about the about the people in america each of them is uh
i would say psychotic in his uh his own way but uh normally they appear to be
uh s normal people as as we can see them ev every day uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments
say it's a deep wonderful penetrating uh film extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about american
life and i can fully agree with this user comment uh

he's simulati i i i've seen this movie but i
yeah yeah yeah
mm hmm but then he fell in love with the the with the with the friend of uh his daughter if i remember well that's really
maybe

yeah yeah that's true yeah
uh huh
and i think that's the last
if would like to go for something what is really serious i would definitely uh go for schindler's list and if not uh then
hmm
i would like to see this uh shawshank redemption because it receive i yeah it it none of us seen this
movie unfortunately but uh as you can see from the from your from your table there is a plenty of votes
it's actually i think it's a movie with highest number of the votes yeah it is
morgan freeman yeah
darabont
me neither me neither
yeah but really i would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time
so
and actually i don't think it's it's it's that popular in europe at least because i really you see none of us have seen it so
yeah yeah
yeah

mm hmm
mm hmm
but if i read your first point in the in this uh trivias
i am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training
except for the man matt damon and the reason was that they wan uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other
actors would resent him why this was uh wanted actually
yeah
and they didn't like it they didn't like the mission
mm hmm mm hmm
yeah and it okay
yes most of them so there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
i have no comments no no it's
yeah but i really appreciate your table because i found this table really useful it's a very nice summary
mm hmm
mm hmm
so doing nothing just uh take it easy in the life yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm

mm hmm
and the one on the left is his friend
aha yeah

but this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time i mean it's uh
which ca
from the nineties and he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still as he he would come from the vietnam
okay there i
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

and this one is supposed to be the second lebowski
or who
okay okay

but actually i'm i'm little bit missing th some information about our movie club i think uh there should be some more information
yeah i like this mm hmm

mm hmm
so perhaps we can somehow combine them
i think there is too many colours too many colours nowadays you know if you see some advertisements on the s yeah but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street this is typical typical uh poster i wouldn't wouldn't look at
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm

exactly

mm hmm mm hmm

mm hmm mm hmm
how is it actually r ranked because i cannot see it here in your table
i somehow can't find it
ah forty eight
yeah fifty thousand mm mm
voted yeah
mm hmm
let's nominate okay
so i will take basically two extremes i will take schindler's list and i will take uh the big lebowski
one of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties uh i mean the story is from the nineties while the second one is about the second war and is uh serious
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

okay that's
yeah but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees so i would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you
so then it's it's more complicated but yeah okay let's
mm hmm okay
sixth sense
'kay

seconds
okay and i wi i will give one to the big lebowski and two to the uh uh shawshank redemption
so now try to sum it up
american beauty uh three
mm hmm

mm hmm
but i would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps
mm hmm

i'm yeah sure sorry sorry
i was sleepi sleeping for a while
mm hmm
it should be from this period because nineties
would be finished
mm two thousand
mm hmm
yeah
whatever
first monday of may yeah so it's after the projection and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes yes yes
and perhaps we will have some new members
um


american beauty finally
okay
yep um
so hello everybody so uh you everybody had the a agenda for today you received it or
yep
so the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month so for this
month of of april and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters
and um i i will present you three des different design we'll discuss it so first we have to decide
for um a movie
so i think we all prepared documents
so i propose that we start with uh presentation agnes uh sent
and actually the psychologist is dead


yep
mm

yep
so wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie
yep
it's very well known yeah
i think yeah it's one of the most well known thriller
yeah
that's my impression yeah but it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand
seen it
voted for it
voted for it and i think only two other mov uh no f three other movies uh have uh have more votes
but the kid is seeing dead people i mean is uh it's quite uh
no but it's quite uh morbid you can say that yeah morbid
yeah
they don't remember

yep
so what was you criteria for selecting this movie or
but then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie
only because of the of the end
i i've heard some people in the in the theatre saying oh now we have to see it again
but then if you asked them five minutes ago okay
yeah
okay so uh i think mirek you prepared a presentation also we can have a look

sorry it's control l 
i have s i have seen it but i don't remember it which is not good
but the rating is very good then


it you know if it's to uh if it received some award
or
probably no yeah i think also but uh
yeah yeah
well it's a true story also uh so
and to remember maybe or
yeah
so who has seen it agnes you've seen it
yeah
and it's
it's the comeback from of uh john travolta no so uh
big comeback yeah
bruce willis is there also
yeah
um
sorry
and what's the name of the girl on the poster
um
uma thurman okay
yep
so on the list i i brought on the docu on my document the two movies pulp fiction and usual su suspect are just swapped pulp fiction is actually coming before the usual suspect
yeah tuesday it's quite surprising though but uh okay
yeah
actually i have seen it now i realise yeah yeah no because i thought it was like another movie but it's it's this movie actually
uh les in french
i think it that one but it's very violent
very
it doesn't say it here but uh it's probably rated r 
it speak about uh a guy who is not italian who is uh going up in the hierarchy of mafia
so
the mob so the mob is the mafia actually okay
and jodie foster is very good as well
she was pretty young no for
w w from whe when is the movie
ninety one yeah
yep

but not that good no
okay what's your opinion you have seen it
violent and and uh scary as well mm psychopathic i mean it's uh
okay and last choice
yep that's a good one
and kevin spacey it's no kevin spacey he received something no
he's actually uh quitting his job at the beginning but he's uh simulating a fight with his boss in order to to to pursue pursue to
yeah i think yeah to sue him afterward and then
yeah yeah
yep
no uh there is this rose because the she's he's imagining her taking baths with ro roses all around and uh he's uh yeah
exactly okay
um so what will be your favou your preferred one on in this list
the first one yeah probably yeah you received so yeah
yeah yeah
and it's uh tim robbins and uh who is the
the guy behi morgan freeman yeah yeah great actors
mm yeah
yep okay yep it tells something okay it's just a do we want to have to display the most popular movie or or we're
yeah
that's right yeah
okay andrei yeah can can you comment your
yeah
um yeah i w thank you
yep
and you e
and you enjoyed that the fact the you see clo i
to realise how it wa how it was exactly
yeah it's very different yeah
to make it like uh an historical movie or
yeah mm
oh
yeah
what kind of message sorry i'm not getting your
okay
yep or or we have you have
okay so actually i don't know if uh
y any of you have uh read the document i prepared on the big lebowski
it's below the table yeah i wanted
yeah yeah yeah i wanted to say that uh it's quite open there are many choices possible but then
my proposal is the big lebowski from um the two brothers uh coen coen brothers
and it's a actually joel co coen who uh directed the movie um
the plot is quite hard to to make but maybe you you read it al already you understood something from the plot or
i am
yeah it's it's it's a bit like the f in my opinion like um american beauty because it's
it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the american society and the
the the hero the the dude the mm big lebowksi it's actually his name is
a a kind of non hero but he's representative of the of uh a
normal uh l a  l a  guy and uh he has a friend comi veter veteran
from vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking and they all are together in
a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything they seems to have no job i not know we
never seen i them working yeah
and actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um uh
uh s some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else
and uh the whole story is about uh he wants to to to get some money
out of this story and he's going to see the other lebowski to ask him money because he he
because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment
it's uh jeff bridges and uh john goodman john goodman you have probably seen him in in a series
on the right the guy on the right jeff bridges
yeah he's the one coming uh from from vietnam he's kind of uh
he is still equipped for for war okay so uh
it's f a movie from the nineties actually yep
yep yeah yeah that's a problem i'm going to actually i want to show you some posters i prepared for this movie so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design
so on the left you see the main characters of the movie so the
the hero at the top left then it's the guy coming back from vietnam afterward it's uh
uh a guy who john turturro they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest
and um julianne moore and the last one is buscemi or something like that buscemi he's never speaking in the movie each time he's trying to speak the other one are are stopping him
so it's qu
no he's not on the on the picture the second lebowski
so uh my proposition was to add um the title of course some information abo about the pricing on the right
uh yeah but when it will be printed it will be okay i think
ah you mean
okay so i prepared a second one
where th th th there's there is some information at the bottom we can see that um do you know mondre
montreux english movie club uh i said that people can contact us
to to get to the committee and select movies
so um
okay
but there is a th there is a third one
um actually i i prefer it because it's more colourful also
but it's it can catch the eyes actually but um
but then the problem i preferred the first one because i think it's important to have the plot of movie e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it but uh i don't know
okay
okay so what do you propose what should i do for these posters in terms of content
okay i'll try to do something but first anyway we have to select a movie so i'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom all the information about the committee and the the montreux club okay
okay
okay
okay
okay so just to conti to finish with the big lebowski it's um i think those two images are pretty
representative so the on the first on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that
i introduces the movie and on the bottom it's uh he is he keeps dreaming in th in this
movie because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d put
it or he is drinking too much also so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams very
very weird but interesting
yep yeah yeah
actually she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the big lebowski to have kids with him but he doesn't know so maybe he's making strange uh
okay

yeah yeah it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually
it's um no it is on in the table actually it's um it's coming at the end forty eight but quite a lot of people have seen it actually
yeah
yeah but generally you vote when you have seen the movie no
okay so uh i think we should decide for a movie now
so
maybe each of us can s can select two movies or
okay
um no actually i'm happy with the choices because i really i would really push uh american beauty because i think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward
and it's representative of the nineties i think
okay yeah
okay start andrei no
i don't want to finish i think i'm going to
no
yeah maybe it makes more sense yeah
okay me i put two to american beauty
and uh one to saving private ryan
no big lebowski i nominate
so do we have something
yeah that's the only thing that's worrying me but it should be okay yeah yeah
so you select you wanted actually me to select the this design that takes a bit more
time but if you c if all of you can send me one image i can make something on the left select
one image from the movie and uh
with a different title okay no but i'll make something
julianne moore actually uh
she's playing in the no in american beauty
ah okay
okay uh we s
we still have to decide for next meeting and we're all set
uh by uh monday next monday
i think we can meet at the same period
yeah
no
first monday of may
yep
but then in june what are we going to do in june because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand
yeah
yeah maybe
okay thank you
so what's the movie again
okay thank you
'kay so we'll try to zip through this since we're short on time welcome everybody um hope your sessions
went well um so this is our functional design meeting
we're going to consider um user needs technical effects
and the working design of our remote control um i've been taking meetings
on the minute minutes on the meetings and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything
you need to refer to you can find them in there um i i'll get the ones up for next time
um they're not finished yet right um so can we have updates from everyone from
what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share
or discuss in this sure
hm
no any any order's fine yeah
oh yeah sorry
it sh it takes a few seconds i think
uh huh and then press function
and f  eight
here we are

oh is it on okay
hm
'kay
yeah just move right on
uh function f  eight
it's the little blue w it's the one th yeah
yeah should be
it should be yeah


'kay
okay well thank you everybody um we have we'll discuss that and then i just
wanna mention some new project requirements that came in um teletext
is apparently outdated so due to internet popularity so
that's off the list um
also our remote should be used only for television um no extra internet kinda
fancy things just the remote and the television um and also we
need to incorporate our corporate image onto this so um
the
phrase is we put fashion in electronics so let's be fashionable i guess
um if we have something i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours so if
we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw and yellow writing
something like that okay um
so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions um
yeah do let's i guess we should yeah make some
kind of brainstorming see what we can
wha what um well probably our target group and
how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s the buttons and what
it does and that sort of thing so
i think that seems to yeah mm
yeah teenagers and young professionals
oh uh
yeah
mm
and if if you consider our budget it probably if you consider our budget to h have speech recognition
programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey yeah
right so um
yeah
yeah
okay
so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right
yeah yeah
so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals huh
okay
yeah
we probably leave that i mean i guess one takes care of the other like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's
yeah
yeah
yeah
and like if the if the phone's under the couch you might not see the light so yeah
so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i don't remember who showed them yeah you you did um they're i mean one looked like it was for v c r  type thing and the other looked like just television
oh really
'cause that that is something we have to decide is whether we want to have v c r  capabilities
they're not no
yeah that's right yeah but d v d  probably is
and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers i mean it's gonna be d v d  type that's the the technology these days
yeah
yeah
s
huh
you know i've seen some remotes that where you just hold one like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on so you don't actually have a separate power button it's just
but
it might be confusing yeah
yeah
besides you like to be able to go power i have the power i guess so we definitely want a power button and numbers right
mm
mm
yeah
oh that's gonna
is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of okay
i've never used one no
okay
okay
well i
we could we could even have four buttons like if that's the if that's the mouse you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well

huh
so it's like holding
you can o
and you
you is there an extra actual button or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down like
mm hmm
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
well i mean if if you're gonna this for channels right then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow like you could just have
oh like
oh you could actually
yeah
is that what makes them expensi i think it's all of they have so much memory though that's it's
yeah i think it's the uh h it's their capabili i mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something
yeah yeah yeah
s
mm
um
you know actually our our new project requirements i'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television
as in not for d v d  or just not internet type things so i'll i'll check that and update you on
the next but we'll hold off on that 'cause
but s yeah uh
yeah
mm mm
yeah
but i
yeah
um yeah let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up um let's see um so
everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have
thirty minutes of individual work um yeah so think about the things we've discussed
and bring some new ideas to our next meeting see you soon

just uh
you may need to
but sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle so press it a couple times hold down function and then press f  eight
adjusting
the cable might be a little loose or something oh you got it
how do i um
right
okay so this is on the working design which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting
um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions the user
can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t v  and also we talked about um
a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t v  and it would send sort of signal to the remote
where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is
so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote um input which would probably be buttons
although um we just talked about voice recognition processor to take the information um
something to transmit it to the t v  and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal
and have an output like possibly a beep or a vibration and also you need a sender
for location signal which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t v 
or stick it on their wall
and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works power comes from the battery goes to the chip
um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the t v 
and then for the location function you would have a sender on the t v  which would output some sort of signal
um we could use i r  but we'd probably wanna use radio instead that signal would go to a receiver
which it would process it and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up
um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh battery for the energy source that way you wouldn't
have to plug it in um a button pad for input um we can purchase a
pre made chip which will handle all the processing stuff i r  transmitter to communicate to the t v  that's just sort of standard
um so most t v s have an i r  receiver probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive
it and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself
so that concludes my presentation
mm
yeah uh i d i was an engineer before i came here



it's easy to implement
locator
well
i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme and also if the
t v  is on it's making sound and the people on the t v  are talking and if somebody says like one then the t v 's gonna switch itself to channel one
or it seems like a silly i'm not sure how you would implement it

it's a cool idea but

well you would have to have a button on a t v  or on your wall or some place since the t v  already has power
yeah you click the button it's gonna send out a signal and i was thinking i r  is line of sight so unless the
remote is like actually in front of the t v  it's not gonna work um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell
phone sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably
it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote
yeah it'd probably just stick it on your t v  so if you need to find the remote click the button
yeah so it would be a two part package

yeah i think so

um on the t v  or on the phone um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me i think that's what the phone has i mean when you need to find your phone you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever

does anyone know if v c r s are the same across international
okay so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v c r s
yeah other than that region and coding thing
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah i never think to hold something down

yeah you can have the number going around in the corner
doesn't it rotate though so it'll be moving around
mm hmm
if it works on an ipod then it works
i don't have one
oh
yeah
i don't think so
i don't think it's the wheel dealy
yeah
and they're re programmable aren't they you can put on your songs and then put on a different set that's probably why they're expensive they're like little computers
mm hmm

i
a d v d  is simple you just have play pause eject
and menu maybe
oh yeah
but it's cool to have it all on one because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume and then you wanna go to the menu so you don't wanna switch
well but d v d  is only like four buttons
oh but i think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to d v d  really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the t v  so you don't have to switch
yes we can try that
who's that
could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh
right
so get this
okay so now i need to press f  eight what is it
'kay what's function
oh function i see it
there we go

okay um
this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um
just what what functions we need and how to make that
the best function for the user so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet
and okay so basically um i think i uh like it is really important that
we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way um so i think things
like uh
you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way
uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour
keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum and also things like
is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough
large enough i'm not sure we c i guess we would need to
do some research about i would about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing um but basically
we need to make sure that it turns on and off the t v  does it have like capacity to change the channels um
does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v c r  and then
is it findable and uh how do we wanna do that and
um
i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring um i dunno if this will work but
and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those
just i mean i like the one on the right better just because it does have fewer buttons uh but i mean i think we sh can sort
of think about things like um like colour and you know size
shapes that sort of thing to best fit the user
that concludes my presentation
okay you need the little thingy
ooh
do you know about like i dunno you seem like you know about
okay cool
like in terms of
how it looks or like what it does
okay
yeah okay
so
is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button
so
okay so the yeah yeah yeah so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range what was it
oh
yeah yeah

yeah
hu yeah
okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the t v  itself
yeah
okay okay alright
okay
so it's now like a two part thing okay alright
so we get to design that too make it fashionable
um okay
yeah
then it can live anywhere
yeah
t
so i yeah
that was that was me
i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes and uh
yeah
s
um
yeah so okay let's see if i can i think still though
it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know like 'cause if you just have like one menu button
that works like with a
you know or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the t v 
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it seems like that would be hard though i mean like because unless you know yeah just 'cause i wouldn't i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button yeah b yeah
yeah
that sort of like joystick flat touch thing yeah
yeah yeah i think that's an interesting idea 'cause it's cool it's it's funny like you f like i just i don't have an ipod but
like i you know i just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you
just figure out how to use it quite easily like it's not that hard you know
yeah and it is yeah it is really but do you need a screen then do you have to have a screen then
yeah okay yeah yeah okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button
like a disc
yeah yeah it's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad
yeah
yeah and then
okay so like it's like a little part of the circle that
or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can
zap okay
yeah so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to okay
well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like
i mean like okay 'cause so
i dunno i guess okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise that that means you're gonna go up the channels and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down but then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where
like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way that's that way and volume is up and down
it just
it just kno the ipod knows s
yeah so you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want
okay that's what i mean okay
okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up go up and down
it's like a b
like
i think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod but the only thing is like ipods are so expensive like it has to be is that part of yeah i dunno i dunno you don't think so okay
okay
yeah i'm thinking we could if if we're hav so ba i mean but an ipod just has that circle thing you know
yeah yeah well like since it just has the circle thing you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape like it could be a cool sort of you know because it could be circular you know or something weird like that just
yeah
yeah
so okay this is just for t v  it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with
yeah so how do you switch
okay
so like if we had that
yeah
that's true yeah so i know i'm not c really clear on what
yeah yeah
so you'd have to have like i think you would have to have like a function switch button you know somewhere so like you can you're either on t v  you're on d v d  or you're on v c r  or you're like so
yeah but i mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc the touch pad
yeah but it it would be
so but i'm saying like does it make sense to have like some kind of a button so like you're if you're on t v  like you can switch
channels but then if uh if you're on d v d  then like the channel bu like the
the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know to different
i mean do we need to think about that that like

okay
and i can start if you want mm
is there an order no we haven't decided on an order
first okay um how do i put this i'll just put the cable in

is that it can you see oh here okay
so what happens it doesn't work

no
is it in the right thing
oh wait um
uh you need to help me

yeah
oh wait that's is that it
right here we are we're here okay um in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found um
a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits
to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out um
the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about custome
customers and users don't like the way remote controls look they don't like the way they feel
they don't think they match their operating behaviour and an example is what we were talking about the buttons
they only use ten per cent of the buttons so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design
according to these buttons easy to lose and r s i  i don't know what r s i  means um
the person that did the questionnaire obviously did i don't have a clue
um according to the frequency of use and the relevance of
each buttons i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance
so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection they're used about a hundred and sixty
times per hour and um
yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently so this is the order channel selection teletext
volume and power the other ones are the settings and they're used less than
you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button
for all the settings and then just one and then from there go on to the audio on the screen either
on the remote or on the television um
about the screen and speech recognition some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that
and if we look at the market f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old
year olds i don't really know how to describe this um ninety one to seventy six percent
of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product while people that
are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent so people
that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing um i don't
i don't know um what the decision to be made is but i think that the people that actually do
buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um
most likely but we should discuss this together
and that's all i have to say about the matter um
shall i what do i do do i give this to someone else
function f  eight
s
that's on view oh
how it looks or
the the buzzer you mean yeah for sure yeah
well that's for speech recognition
and screen that's only for speech recognition and screen
yeah yeah yeah i mean
i just put the values in but um the screen is the same as what
yeah i'm happy with that completely
yeah
yeah okay
so do you plug it in the t  you plug it in t v  this thing
okay okay
okay
yeah just there
mm are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now
okay
okay for the so you have that button that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio
are we just having a radio
on the phone
you don't need a light yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you can hear it's under the couch yeah um
so need the other buttons so we have this mm
mm hmm
they're not no
it not v h s  here
but v c r s
yeah yeah for sure
well for sure we need the um i think we can just design the
channels i mean power's just a button and it's not used that much s and it's usually that red and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red
oh okay yeah
yeah
well even um ipod thing like um i don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number
of buttons instead of having like one to nine have a sort of
scrolling i don't know yeah because people li seem now the ipod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no
know you don't have one two three four five
yeah yeah it's just and it's one thing which has everything
well can't it tell the like can't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then
it's like l this like that and then you do that
and then you can have um if you actually just want to zap you can have like a thing
like that and that and then it can just be plus and minus
yeah you can
yeah click o actually click on to have
yeah
what do you mean the function
yeah
yeah
yeah but it knows for some reason the ipod knows

well for the volume you have to press the middle and then go up
and then well if you do that it goes but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here that i've seen
well what you for the ipod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say then you press on the middle and
then if you do that again the volume goes up and if you do that it goes down but if you wanna keep it with volume here
and here i'm pretty sure
yeah
i don't know you could click and then have it up and down but i think
yeah yeah yeah
i think it
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass because the other thing
i didn't tell you all my presentation is that people find it
find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about um what other buttons were there volume oh we've ts just said that
channel selection
menu
but d v d  players usually have their own remote
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah it is only fun
okay
